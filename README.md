OxGarage is a web, and RESTful, service to manage the transformation of documents between a variety of formats. The majority of transformations use the Text Encoding Initiative format as a pivot format.

OxGarage is based on the Enrich Garage Engine developed by Poznan Supercomputing and Networking Center and Oxford University Computing Services for the EU-funded ENRICH project.
