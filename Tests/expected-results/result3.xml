            <head>Some Chaucer</head>
            <p>Whan folk hadde laughen at this nyce cas </p>
            <p>Of absolon and hende nicholas, </p>
            <p>Diverse folk diversely they seyde, </p>
            <p>But for the moore part they loughe and pleyde. </p>
            <p>Ne at this tale I saugh no man hym greve, </p>
            <p>But it were oonly osewold the reve. </p>
            <p>By cause he was of carpenteris craft, </p>
            <p>A litel ire is in his herte ylaft; </p>
            <p>He gan to grucche, and blamed it a lite. </p>
            <p>So theek, quod he, ful wel koude I thee quite </p>
            <p>With bleryng of a proud milleres ye, </p>
            <p>If that me liste speke of ribaudye. </p>
            <p>But ik am oold, me list not pley for age; </p>
            <p>Gras tyme is doon, my fodder is now forage; </p>
            <p>This white top writeth myne olde yeris; </p>
            <p>Myn herte is also mowled as myne heris, </p>
            <p>But if I fare as dooth an open-ers, -- </p>
            <p>That ilke fruyt is ever lenger the wers, </p>
            <p>Til it be roten in mullok or in stree. </p>
            <p>We olde men, I drede, so fare we: </p>
            <p>Til we be roten, kan we nat be rype; </p>
            <p>We hoppen alwey whil the world wol pype. </p>
            <p>For in oure wyl ther stiketh evere a nayl, </p>
            <p>To have an hoor heed and a grene tayl, </p>
            <p>As hath a leek; for thogh oure myght be goon, </p>
            <p>Oure wyl desireth folie evere in oon. </p>
            <p>For whan we may nat doon, than wol we speke; </p>
            <p>Yet in oure asshen olde is fyr yreke. </p>
            <p>Foure gleedes han we, which I shal devyse, -- </p>
            <p>Avauntyng, liyng, anger, coveitise; </p>
            <p>Thise foure sparkles longen unto eelde. </p>
            <p>Oure olde lemes mowe wel been unweelde, </p>
            <p>But wyl ne shal nat faillen, that is sooth. </p>
            <p>And yet ik have alwey a coltes tooth, </p>
            <p>As many a yeer as it is passed henne </p>
            <p>Syn that my tappe of lif bigan to renne. </p>
            <p>For sikerly, whan I was bore, anon </p>
            <p>Deeth drough the tappe of lyf and leet it gon; </p>
            <p>And ever sithe hath so the tappe yronne </p>
            <p>Til that almoost al empty is the tonne. </p>
            <p>The streem of lyf now droppeth on the chymbe. </p>
            <p>The sely tonge may wel rynge and chymbe </p>
            <p>Of wrecchednesse that passed is ful yoore; </p>
            <p>With olde folk, save dotage, is namoore! </p>
            <p>Whan that oure hoost hadde herd this sermonyng, </p>
            <p>He gan to speke as lordly as a kyng. </p>
            <p>He seide, what amounteth al this wit? </p>
            <p>What shul we speke alday of hooly writ? </p>
            <p>The devel made a reve for to preche, </p>
            <p>Or of a soutere a shipman or a leche. </p>
            <p>Sey forth thy tale, and tarie nat the tyme </p>
            <p>Lo depeford! and it is half-wey pryme. </p>
            <p>Lo grenewych, ther many a shrewe is inne! </p>
            <p>It were al tyme thy tale to bigynne. </p>
            <p>Now, sires, quod this osewold the reve, </p>
            <p>I pray yow alle that ye nat yow greve, </p>
            <p>Thogh I answere, and somdeel sette his howve; </p>
            <p>For leveful is with force force of-showve. </p>
            <p>This dronke millere hath ytoold us heer </p>
            <p>How that bigyled was a carpenteer, </p>
            <p>Peraventure in scorn, for I am oon. </p>
            <p>And, by youre leve, I shal hym quite anoon; </p>
            <p>Right in his cherles termes wol I speke. </p>
            <p>I pray to God his nekke mote to-breke; </p>
            <p>He kan wel in myn eye seen a stalke, </p>
            <p>But in his owene he kan nat seen a balke. </p>
