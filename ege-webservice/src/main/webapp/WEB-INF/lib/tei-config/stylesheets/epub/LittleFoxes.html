<h1 class="head">Little Foxes</h1>
<h1 class="head">A Tale of the Gihon Hunt</h1>
<p><span id="d23e5489"><!--anchor1--></span>A FOX came out of his earth on the banks of the Great River Gihon, which
waters Ethiopia. He saw a white man riding through the dry
dhurra-stalks, and, that his destiny might be fulfilled, barked at
him.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5492"><!--anchor1--></span>The rider drew rein among the villagers round his stirrup.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5495"><!--anchor1--></span>“What,” said he, “is that?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5499"><!--anchor1--></span>“That,” said the Sheikh of the village, “is a
fox, O Excellency Our Governor.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5502"><!--anchor1--></span>“It is not, then, a jackal?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5505"><!--anchor1--></span>“No jackal, but Abu Hussein the father of
cunning.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5508"><!--anchor1--></span>“Also,” the white man spoke half aloud, “I am
Mudir of this Province.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5511"><!--anchor1--></span>“It is true,” they cried. “<strong>Ya, Saart el
Mudir</strong>” (O Excellency Our Governor).</p>
<p><span id="d23e5517"><!--anchor1--></span>The Great River Gihon, well used to the moods of kings, slid
between his mile-wide banks toward the sea, while the Governor
praised God in a loud and searching cry never before heard by the
river.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5521"><!--anchor1--></span>When he had lowered his right forefinger from behind his right
ear, the villagers talked to him of their crops—barley,
dhurrah, millet, onions, and the like. The Governor stood in his
stirrups. North he looked up a strip of green cultivation a few
hundred yards wide that lay like a carpet between the river and the
tawny line of the desert. Sixty miles that strip stretched before
him, and as many behind. At every half-mile a groaning water-wheel
lifted the soft water from the river to the crops by way of a
mud-built aqueduct. A foot or so wide was the water-channel; five
foot or more high was the bank on which it ran, and its base was
broad in proportion. Abu Hussein, misnamed the Father of Cunning,
drank from the river below his earth, and his shadow was long in
the low sun. He could not understand the loud cry which the
Governor had cried.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5524"><!--anchor1--></span>The Sheikh of the village spoke of the crops from which the
rulers of all lands draw revenue; but the Governor’s eyes
were fixed, between his horse’s ears, on the nearest
water-channel.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5527"><!--anchor1--></span>“Very like a ditch in Ireland,” he murmured, and
smiled, dreaming of a razor-topped bank in distant Kildare.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5530"><!--anchor1--></span>Encouraged by that smile, the Sheikh continued. “When
crops fail it is necessary to remit taxation. Then it is a good
thing, O Excellency Our Governor, that you come and see the crops
which have failed, and discover that we have not lied.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5533"><!--anchor1--></span>“Assuredly.” The Governor shortened his reins. The
horse cantered on, rose at the embankment of the water-channel,
changed leg cleverly on top, and hopped down in a cloud of golden
dust.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5536"><!--anchor1--></span>Abu Hussein from his earth watched with interest. He had never
before seen such things.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5540"><!--anchor1--></span>“Assuredly,” the Governor repeated, and came back by
the way he had gone. “It is always best to see for
one’s self.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5543"><!--anchor1--></span>An ancient and still bullet-speckled stern-wheel steamer, with a
barge lashed to her side, came round the river bend. She whistled
to tell the Governor his dinner was ready, and the horse, seeing
his fodder piled on the barge, whinnied back.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5546"><!--anchor1--></span>“Moreover,” the Sheikh added, “in the days of
the Oppression the Emirs and their creatures dispossessed many
people of their lands. All up and down the river our people are
waiting to return to their lawful fields.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5549"><!--anchor1--></span>“Judges have been appointed to settle that matter,”
said the Governor. “They will presently come in steamers and
hear the witnesses.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5552"><!--anchor1--></span>“Wherefore? Did the Judges kill the Emirs? We would rather
be judged by the men who executed God’s judgment on the
Emirs. We would rather abide by <em>your</em> decision, O Excellency Our
Governor.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5558"><!--anchor1--></span>The Governor nodded. It was a year since he had seen the Emirs
stretched close and still round the reddened sheepskin where lay El
Mahdi, the Prophet of God. Now there remained no trace of their
dominion except the old steamer, once part of a Dervish flotilla,
which was his house and office. She sidled into the shore, lowered
a plank, and the Governor followed his horse aboard.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5562"><!--anchor1--></span>Lights burned on her till late, dully reflected in the river
that tugged at her mooring-ropes. The Governor read, not for the
first time, the administration reports of one John Jorrocks,
M.F.H.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5565"><!--anchor1--></span>“We shall need,” he said suddenly to his Inspector,
“about ten couple. I’ll get ’em when I go home.
You’ll be Whip, Baker?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5568"><!--anchor1--></span>The Inspector, who was not yet twenty-five, signified his assent
in the usual manner, while Abu Hussein barked at the vast desert
moon.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5571"><!--anchor1--></span>“Ha!” said the Governor, coming out in his pyjamas,
“we’ll be giving you capivi in another three months, my
friend.”</p>

<div class="teidiv0" id="index-group.1_text.7_body.1_div.1"><h2>1. 
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</h2>

<p><span id="d23e5580"><!--anchor1--></span>It was four, as a matter of fact, ere a steamer with a melodious
bargeful of hounds anchored at that landing. The Inspector leaped
down among them, and the homesick wanderers received him as a
brother.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5583"><!--anchor1--></span>“Everybody fed ’em everything on board ship, but
they’re real dainty hounds at bottom,” the Governor
explained. “That’s Royal you’ve got hold
of—the pick of the bunch—and the bitch that’s
got, hold of you—she’s a little excited—is May
Queen. Merriman, out of Cottesmore Maudlin, you know.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5586"><!--anchor1--></span>“I know. ’Grand old bitch with the tan
eyebrows,”’ the Inspector cooed. “Oh, Ben! I
shall take an interest in life now. Hark to ’em! O
hark!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5589"><!--anchor1--></span>Abu Hussein, under the high bank, went about his night’s
work. An eddy carried his scent to the barge, and three villages
heard the crash of music that followed. Even then Abu Hussein did
not know better than to bark in reply.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5592"><!--anchor1--></span>“Well, what about my Province?” the Governor
asked.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5596"><!--anchor1--></span>“Not so bad,” the Inspector answered, with
Royal’s head between his knees. “Of course, all the
villages want remission of taxes, but, as far as I can see, the
whole country’s stinkin’ with foxes. Our trouble will
be choppin’ ’em in cover. I’ve got a list of the
only villages entitled to any remission. What d’you call this
flat-sided, blue-mottled beast with the jowl?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5599"><!--anchor1--></span>“Beagle-boy. I have my doubts about him. Do you think we
can get two days a week?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5602"><!--anchor1--></span>“Easy; and as many byes as you please. The Sheikh of this
village here tells me that his barley has failed, and he wants a
fifty per cent remission.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5605"><!--anchor1--></span>“We’ll begin with him to-morrow, and look at his
crops as we go. Nothing like personal supervision,” said the
Governor.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5608"><!--anchor1--></span>They began at sunrise. The pack flew off the barge in every
direction, and, after gambols, dug like terriers at Abu
Hussein’s many earths. Then they drank themselves pot-bellied
on Gihon water while the Governor and the Inspector chastised them
with whips. Scorpions were added; for May Queen nosed one, and was
removed to the barge lamenting. Mystery (a puppy, alas!) met a
snake, and the blue-mottled Beagle-boy (never a dainty hound) ate
that which he should have passed by. Only Royal, of the Belvoir tan
head and the sad, discerning eyes, made any attempt to uphold the
honour of England before the watching village.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5611"><!--anchor1--></span>“You can’t expect everything,” said the
Governor after breakfast.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5615"><!--anchor1--></span>“We got it, though—everything except foxes. Have you
seen May Queen’s nose?” said the Inspector.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5618"><!--anchor1--></span>“And Mystery’s dead. We’ll keep ’em
coupled next time till we get well in among the crops. I say, what
a babbling body-snatcher that Beagle-boy is! Ought to be
drowned!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5621"><!--anchor1--></span>“They bury people so damn casual hereabouts. Give him
another chance,” the Inspector pleaded, not knowing that he
should live to repent most bitterly.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5624"><!--anchor1--></span>“Talkin’ of chances,” said the Governor,
“this Sheikh lies about his barley bein’ a failure. If
it’s high enough to hide a hound at this time of year,
it’s all right. And he wants a fifty per cent remission, you
said?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5627"><!--anchor1--></span>“You didn’t go on past the melon patch where I tried
to turn Wanderer. It’s all burned up from there on to the
desert. His other water-wheel has broken down, too,” the
Inspector replied.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5630"><!--anchor1--></span>“Very good. We’ll split the difference and allow him
twenty-five per cent off. Where’ll we meet
to-morrow?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5634"><!--anchor1--></span>“There’s some trouble among the villages down the
river about their land-titles. It’s good goin’ ground
there, too,” the Inspector said.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5637"><!--anchor1--></span>The next meet, then, was some twenty miles down the river, and
the pack were not enlarged till they were fairly among the fields.
Abu Hussein was there in force—four of him. Four delirious
hunts of four minutes each—four hounds per fox—ended in
four earths just above the river. All the village looked on.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5640"><!--anchor1--></span>“We forgot about the earths. The banks are riddled with
’em. This’ll defeat us,” said the Inspector.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5643"><!--anchor1--></span>“Wait a moment!” The Governor drew forth a sneezing
hound. “I’ve just remembered I’m Governor of
these parts.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5646"><!--anchor1--></span>“Then turn out a black battalion to stop for us.
We’ll need ’em, old man.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5649"><!--anchor1--></span>The Governor straightened his back. “Give ear, O
people!” he cried. “I make a new Law!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5653"><!--anchor1--></span>The villagers closed in. He called:—</p>
<p><span id="d23e5656"><!--anchor1--></span>“Henceforward I will give one dollar to the man on whose
land Abu Hussein is found. And another dollar”—he held
up the coin—“to the man on whose land these dogs shall
kill him. But to the man on whose land Abu Hussein shall run into a
hole such as is this hole, I will give not dollars, but a most
unmeasurable beating. Is it understood?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5659"><!--anchor1--></span>“Our Excellency,” a man stepped forth, “on my
land Abu Hussein was found this morning. Is it not so,
brothers?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5662"><!--anchor1--></span>None denied. The Governor tossed him over four dollars without a
word.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5665"><!--anchor1--></span>“On my land they all went into their holes,” cried
another. “Therefore I must be beaten.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5668"><!--anchor1--></span>“Not so. The land is mine, and mine are the
beatings.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5672"><!--anchor1--></span>This second speaker thrust forward his shoulders already bared,
and the villagers shouted.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5675"><!--anchor1--></span>“Hullo! Two men anxious to be licked? There must be some
swindle about the land,” said the Governor. Then in the local
vernacular: “What are your rights to the beating?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5678"><!--anchor1--></span>As a river-reach changes beneath a slant of the sun, that which
had been a scattered mob changed to a court of most ancient
justice. The hounds tore and sobbed at Abu Hussein’s
hearthstone, all unnoticed among the legs of the witnesses, and
Gihon, also accustomed to laws, purred approval.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5681"><!--anchor1--></span>“You will not wait till the Judges come up the river to
settle the dispute?” said the Governor at last.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5684"><!--anchor1--></span>“No!” shouted all the village save the man who had
first asked to be beaten. “We will abide by Our
Excellency’s decision. Let Our Excellency turn out the
creatures of the Emirs who stole our land in the days of the
Oppression.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5687"><!--anchor1--></span>“And thou sayest?” the Governor turned to the man
who had first asked to be beaten.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5691"><!--anchor1--></span>“I say <em>I</em> will wait till the wise Judges come down in the
steamer. Then I will bring my many witnesses,” he
replied.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5697"><!--anchor1--></span>“He is rich. He will bring many witnesses,” the
village Sheikh muttered.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5700"><!--anchor1--></span>“No need. Thy own mouth condemns thee!” the Governor
cried. “No man lawfully entitled to his land would wait one
hour before entering upon it. Stand aside!” The man, fell
back, and the village jeered him.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5703"><!--anchor1--></span>The second claimant stooped quickly beneath the lifted
hunting-crop. The village rejoiced.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5706"><!--anchor1--></span>“Oh, Such an one; Son of such an one,” said the
Governor, prompted by the Sheikh, “learn, from the day when I
send the order, to block up all the holes where Abu Hussein may
hide on—thy—land!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5709"><!--anchor1--></span>The light flicks ended. The man stood up triumphant. By that
accolade had the Supreme Government acknowledged his title before
all men.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5713"><!--anchor1--></span>While the village praised the perspicacity of the Governor, a
naked, pock-marked child strode forward to the earth, and stood on
one leg, unconcerned as a young stork.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5716"><!--anchor1--></span>“Hal” he said, hands behind his back. “This
should be blocked up with bundles of dhurra stalks—or,
better, bundles of thorns.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5719"><!--anchor1--></span>“Better thorns,” said the Governor. “Thick
ends innermost.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5722"><!--anchor1--></span>The child nodded gravely and squatted on the sand.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5725"><!--anchor1--></span>“An evil day for thee, Abu Hussein,” he shrilled
into the mouth of the earth. “A day of obstacles to thy
flagitious returns in the morning.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5728"><!--anchor1--></span>“Who is it?” the Governor asked the Sheikh.
“It thinks.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5732"><!--anchor1--></span>“Farag the Fatherless. His people were slain in the days
of the Oppression. The man to whom Our Excellency has awarded the
land is, as it were, his maternal uncle.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5735"><!--anchor1--></span>“Will it come with me and feed the big dogs?” said
the Governor.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5738"><!--anchor1--></span>The other peering children drew back. “Run!” they
cried. “Our Excellency will feed Farag to the big
dogs.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5741"><!--anchor1--></span>“I will come,” said Farag. “And I will never
go.” He threw his arm round Royal’s neck, and the wise
beast licked his face.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5744"><!--anchor1--></span>“Binjamin, by Jove!” the Inspector cried.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5747"><!--anchor1--></span>“No!” said the Governor. “I believe he has the
makings of a James Pigg!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5751"><!--anchor1--></span>Farag waved his hand to his uncle, and led Royal on to the
barge. The rest of the pack followed.</p>
</div>
<div class="teidiv0" id="index-group.1_text.7_body.1_div.2"><h2>2. 
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</h2>


<p><span id="d23e5763"><!--anchor1--></span>Gihon, that had seen many sports, learned to know the Hunt barge
well. He met her rounding his bends on grey December dawns to music
wild and lamentable as the almost forgotten throb of Dervish drums,
when, high above Royal’s tenor bell, sharper even than lying
Beagle-boy’s falsetto break, Farag chanted deathless war
against Abu Hussein and all his seed. At sunrise the river would
shoulder her carefully into her place, and listen to the rush and
scutter of the pack fleeing up the gang-plank, and the tramp of the
Governor’s Arab behind them. They would pass over the brow
into the dewless crops where Gihon, low and shrunken, could only
guess what they were about when Abu Hussein flew down the bank to
scratch at a stopped earth, and flew back into the barley again. As
Farag had foretold, it was evil days for Abu Hussein ere he learned
to take the necessary steps and to get away crisply. Sometimes
Gihon saw the whole procession of the Hunt silhouetted against the
morning-blue, bearing him company for many merry miles. At every
half mile the horses and the donkeys jumped the
water-channels—up, on, change your leg, and off again like
figures in a zoetrope, till they grew small along the line of
waterwheels. Then Gibon waited their rustling return through the
crops, and took them to rest on his bosom at ten o’clock.
While the horses ate, and Farag slept with his head on
Royal’s flank, the Governor and his Inspector worked for the
good of the Hunt and his Province.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5766"><!--anchor1--></span>After a little time there was no need to beat any man for
neglecting his earths. The steamer’s destination was
telegraphed from waterwheel to waterwheel, and the villagers
stopped out and put to according. If an earth were overlooked, it
meant some dispute as to the ownership of the land, and then and
there the Hunt checked and settled it in this wise: The Governor
and the Inspector side by side, but the latter half a horse’s
length to the rear; both bare-shouldered claimants well in front;
the villagers half-mooned behind them, and Farag with the pack, who
quite understood the performance, sitting down on the left. Twenty
minutes were enough to settle the most complicated case, for, as
the Governor said to a judge on the steamer, “One gets at the
truth in a hunting-field a heap quicker than in your
lawcourts.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5769"><!--anchor1--></span>“But when the evidence is conflicting?” the Judge
suggested.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5772"><!--anchor1--></span>“Watch the field. They’ll throw tongue fast enough
if you’re running a wrong scent. You’ve never had an
appeal from one of my decisions yet.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5776"><!--anchor1--></span>The Sheikhs on horseback—the lesser folk on clever
donkeys—the children so despised by Farag soon understood
that villages which repaired their waterwheels and channels stood
highest in the Governor’s favour. He bought their barley, for
his horses.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5779"><!--anchor1--></span>“Channels,” he said, “are necessary that we
may all jump them. They are necessary, moreover, for the crops. Let
there be many wheels and sound channels—and much good
barley.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5782"><!--anchor1--></span>“Without money,” replied an aged Sheikh,
“there are no waterwheels.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5785"><!--anchor1--></span>“I will lend the money,” said the Governor.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5788"><!--anchor1--></span>“At what interest, O Our Excellency?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5791"><!--anchor1--></span>“Take you two of May Queen’s puppies to bring up in
your village in such a manner that they do not eat filth, nor lose
their hair, nor catch fever from lying in the sun, but become wise
hounds.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5795"><!--anchor1--></span>“Like Ray-yal—not like Bigglebai?” (Already it
was an insult along the River to compare a man to the shifty
anthropophagous blue-mottled harrier.)</p>
<p><span id="d23e5798"><!--anchor1--></span>“Certainly, like Ray-yal—not in the least like
Bigglebai. <em>That</em> shall be the interest on the loan. Let the puppies
thrive and the waterwheel be built, and I shall be content,”
said the Governor.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5804"><!--anchor1--></span>“The wheel shall be built, but, O Our Excellency, if by
God’s favour the pups grow to be well-smelters, not
filth-eaters, not unaccustomed to their names, not lawless, who
will do them and me justice at the time of judging the young
dogs?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5807"><!--anchor1--></span>“Hounds, man, hounds! Ha-wands, O Sheikh, we call them in
their manhood.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5810"><!--anchor1--></span>“The ha-wands when they are judged at the Sha-ho. I have
unfriends down the river to whom Our Excellency has also entrusted
ha-wands to bring up.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5813"><!--anchor1--></span>“Puppies, man! Pah-peaz we call them, O Sheikh, in their
childhood.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5817"><!--anchor1--></span>“Pah-peat. My enemies may judge my pah-peaz unjustly at
the Sha-ho. This must be thought of.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5820"><!--anchor1--></span>“I see the obstacle. Hear now! If the new waterwheel is
built in a month without oppression, thou, O Sheikh, shalt be named
one of the judges to judge the pah-peaz at the Sha-ho. Is it
understood?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5823"><!--anchor1--></span>“Understood. We will build the wheel. I and my seed are
responsible for the repayment of the loan. Where are my pah-peaz?
If they eat fowls, must they on any account eat the
feathers?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5826"><!--anchor1--></span>“On no account must they eat the feathers. Farag in the
barge will tell thee how they are to live.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5829"><!--anchor1--></span>There is no instance of any default on the Governor’s
personal and unauthorized loans, for which they called him the
Father of Waterwheels. But the first puppyshow at the capital
needed enormous tact and the presence of a black battalion
ostentatiously drilling in the barrack square to prevent trouble
after the prize-giving.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5832"><!--anchor1--></span>But who can chronicle the glories of the Gihon Hunt—or
their shames? Who remembers the kill in the market-place, when the
Governor bade the assembled sheikhs and warriors observe how the
hounds would instantly devour the body of Abu Hussein; but how,
when he had scientifically broken it up, the weary pack turned from
it in loathing, and Farag wept because he said the world’s
face had been blackened? What men who have not yet ridden beyond
the sound of any horn recall the midnight run which
ended—Beagleboy leading—among tombs; the hasty
whip-off, and the oath, taken Abo e bones, to forget the worry? The
desert run, when Abu Hussein forsook the cultivation, and made a
six-mile point to earth in a desolate khor—when strange armed
riders on camels swooped out of a ravine, and instead of giving
battle, offered to take the tired hounds home on their beasts.
Which they did, and vanished.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5836"><!--anchor1--></span>Above all, who remembers the death of Royal, when a certain
Sheikh wept above the body of the stainless hound as it might have
been his son’s—and that day the Hunt rode no more? The
badly-kept log-book says little of this, but at the end of their
second season (forty-nine brace) appears the dark entry: “New
blood badly wanted. They are beginning to listen to
beagle-boy.”</p>

<p><span id="d23e5848"><!--anchor1--></span>The Inspector attended to the matter when his leave fell
due.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5851"><!--anchor1--></span>“Remember,” said the Governor, “you must get
us the best blood in England—real, dainty
hounds—expense no object, but don’t trust your own
judgment. Present my letters of introduction, and take what they
give you.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5854"><!--anchor1--></span>The Inspector presented his letters in a society where they make
much of horses, more of hounds, and are tolerably civil to men who
can ride. They passed him from house to house, mounted him
according to his merits, and fed him, after five years of goat chop
and Worcester sauce, perhaps a thought too richly.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5857"><!--anchor1--></span>The seat or castle where he made his great coup does not much
matter. Four Masters of Foxhounds were at table, and in a mellow
hour the Inspector told them stories of the Gihon Hunt. He ended:
“Ben said I wasn’t to trust my own judgment about
hounds, but I think there ought to be a special tariff for
Empire-makers.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5860"><!--anchor1--></span>As soon as his hosts could speak, they reassured him on this
point.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5864"><!--anchor1--></span>“And now tell us about your first puppy-show all over
again,” said one.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5867"><!--anchor1--></span>“And about the earth-stoppin’. Was that all
Ben’s own invention?” said another.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5870"><!--anchor1--></span>“Wait a moment,” said a large, clean-shaven
man—not an M.F.H.—at the end of the table. “Are
your villagers habitually beaten by your Governor when they fail to
stop foxes’ holes?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5873"><!--anchor1--></span>The tone and the phrase were enough even if, as the Inspector
confessed afterwards, the big, blue double-chinned man had not
looked so like Beagle-boy. He took him on for the honour of
Ethiopia.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5876"><!--anchor1--></span>“We only hunt twice a week—sometimes three times.
I’ve never known a man chastised more than four times a week
unless there’s a bye.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5879"><!--anchor1--></span>The large loose-lipped man flung his napkin down, came round the
table, cast himself into the chair next the Inspector, and leaned
forward earnestly, so that he breathed in the Inspector’s
face.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5883"><!--anchor1--></span>“Chastised with what?” he said.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5886"><!--anchor1--></span>“With the <span class="foreign">kourbash</span>—on the feet. A <span class="foreign">kourbash</span> is a
strip of old hippo-hide with a sort of keel on it, like the cutting
edge of a boar’s tusk. But we use the rounded side for a
first offender.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5895"><!--anchor1--></span>“And do any consequences follow this sort of thing? For
the victim, I mean—not for you?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5898"><!--anchor1--></span>“Ve-ry rarely. Let me be fair. I’ve never seen a man
die under the lash, but gangrene may set up if the <span class="foreign">kourbash</span> has
been pickled.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5904"><!--anchor1--></span>“Pickled in what?” All the table was still and
interested.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5907"><!--anchor1--></span>“In copperas, of course. Didn’t you know <em>that</em>?”
said the Inspector.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5914"><!--anchor1--></span>“Thank God I didn’t.” The large man sputtered
visibly.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5917"><!--anchor1--></span>The Inspector wiped his face and grew bolder.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5920"><!--anchor1--></span>“You mustn’t think we’re careless about our
earthstoppers. We’ve a Hunt fund for hot tar. Tar’s a
splendid dressing if the toe-nails aren’t beaten off. But
huntin’ as large a country as we do, we mayn’t be back
at that village for a month, and if the dressings ain’t
renewed, and gangrene sets in, often as not you find your man
pegging about on his stumps. We’ve a well-known local name
for ’em down the river. We call ’em the Mudir’s
Cranes. You see, I persuaded the Governor only to bastinado on one
foot.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5923"><!--anchor1--></span>“On one foot? The Mudir’s Cranes!” The large
man turned purple to the top of his bald head. “ Would you
mind giving me the local word for Mudir’s Cranes?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5926"><!--anchor1--></span>From a too well-stocked memory the Inspector drew one short
adhesive word which surprises by itself even unblushing Ethiopia.
He spelt it out, saw the large man write it down on his cuff and
withdraw. Then the Inspector translated a few of its significations
and implications to the four Masters of Foxhounds. He left three
days later with eight couple of the best hounds in England—a
free and a friendly and an ample gift from four packs to the Gihon
Hunt. He had honestly meant to undeceive the large blue mottled
man, but somehow forgot about it.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5929"><!--anchor1--></span>The new draft marks a new chapter in the Hunt’s history.
From an isolated phenomenon in a barge it became a permanent
institution with brick-built kennels ashore, and an influence
social, political, and administrative, co-terminous with the
boundaries of the province. Ben, the Governor, departed to England,
where he kept a pack of real dainty hounds, but never ceased to
long for the old lawless lot. His successors were <span class="foreign">ex-officio</span>
Masters of the Gihon Hunt, as all Inspectors were Whips. For one
reason; Farag, the kennel huntsman, in khaki and puttees, would
obey nothing under the rank of an Excellency, and the hounds would
obey no one but Farag; for another, the best way of estimating crop
returns and revenue was by riding straight to hounds; for a third,
though Judges down the river issued signed and sealed land-titles
to all lawful owners, yet public opinion along the river never held
any such title valid till it had been confirmed, according to
precedent, by the Governor’s hunting crop in the hunting
field, above the wilfully neglected earth. True, the ceremony had
been cut down to three mere taps on the shoulder, but Governors who
tried to evade that much found themselves and their office
compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses who took up their
time with lawsuits and, worse still, neglected the puppies. The
older sheikhs, indeed, stood out for the unmeasurable beatings of
the old days—the sharper the punishment, they argued, the
surer the title; but here the hand of modern progress was against
them, and they contented themselves with telling tales of Ben the
first Governor, whom they called the Father of Waterwheels, and of
that heroic age when men, horses, and hounds were worth
following.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5936"><!--anchor1--></span>This same Modern Progress which brought dog biscuit and brass
water-taps to the kennels was at work all over the world. Forces,
Activities, and Movements sprang into being, agitated themselves,
coalesced, and, in one political avalanche, overwhelmed a
bewildered, and not in the least intending it, England. The echoes
of the New Era were borne into the Province on the wings of
inexplicable cables. The Gihon Hunt read speeches and sentiments,
and policies which amazed them, and they thanked God, prematurely,
that their Province was too far off, too hot, and too hard worked
to be reached by those speakers or their policies. But they, with
others, under-estimated the scope and purpose of the New Era.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5939"><!--anchor1--></span>One by one, the Provinces of the Empire were hauled up and
baited, hit and held, lashed under the belly, and forced back on
their haunches for the amusement of their new masters in the parish
of Westminster. One by one they fell away, sore and angry, to
compare stripes with each other at the ends of the uneasy earth.
Even so the Gihon Hunt, like Abu Hussein in the old days, did not
understand. Then it reached them through the Press that they
habitually flogged to death good revenue-paying cultivators who
neglected to stop earths; but that the few, the very few who did
not die under hippohide whips soaked in copperas, walked about on
their gangrenous ankle-bones, and were known in derision as the
Mudir’s Cranes. The charges were vouched for in the House of
Commons by a Mr. Lethabie Groombride, who had formed a Committee,
and was disseminating literature: The Province groaned; the
Inspector—now an Inspector of Inspectors—whistled. He
had forgotten the gentleman who sputtered in people’s
faces.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5942"><!--anchor1--></span>“He shouldn’t have looked so like Beagle-boy!”
was his sole defence when he met the Governor at breakfast on the
steamer after a meet.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5945"><!--anchor1--></span>“You shouldn’t have joked with an animal of that
class,” said Peter the Governor. “Look what Farag has
brought me!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5948"><!--anchor1--></span>It was a pamphlet, signed on behalf of a Committee by a lady
secretary, but composed by some person who thoroughly understood
the language of the Province. After telling the tale of the
beatings, it recommended all the beaten to institute criminal
proceedings against their Governor, and, as soon as might be, to
rise against English oppression and tyranny. Such documents were
new in Ethiopia in those days.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5951"><!--anchor1--></span>The Inspector read the last half page.
“But—but,” he stammered, “this is
impossible. White men don’t write this sort of
stuff.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5955"><!--anchor1--></span>“Don’t they, just?” said the Governor.
“They get made Cabinet Ministers for doing it too. I went
home last year. <em>I</em> know.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5961"><!--anchor1--></span>“It’ll blow over,” said the Inspector
weakly.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5964"><!--anchor1--></span>“Not it. Groombride is coming down here to investigate the
matter in a few days.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5967"><!--anchor1--></span>“For himself?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5970"><!--anchor1--></span>“The Imperial Government’s behind him. Perhaps
you’d like to look at my orders.” The Governor laid
down an uncoded cable. The whiplash to it ran: “You will
afford Mr. Groombride every facility for his inquiry, and will be
held responsible that no obstacles are put in his way to the
fullest possible examination of any witnesses which he may consider
necessary. He will be accompanied by his own interpreter, who must
not be tampered with.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5973"><!--anchor1--></span>“That’s to me—Governor of the Province!”
said Peter the Governor.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5977"><!--anchor1--></span>“It seems about enough,” the Inspector answered.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5980"><!--anchor1--></span>Farag, kennel-huntsman, entered the saloon, as was his
privilege.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5983"><!--anchor1--></span>“My uncle, who was beaten by the Father of Waterwheels,
would approach, O Excellency,” he said, “and there are
others on the bank.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5986"><!--anchor1--></span>“Admit,” said the Governor.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5989"><!--anchor1--></span>There tramped aboard sheikhs and villagers to the number of
seventeen. In each man’s hand was a copy of the pamphlet; in
each man’s eye terror and uneasiness of the sort that
Governors spend and are spent to clear away. Farag’s uncle,
now Sheikh of the village, spoke: “It is written in this
book, Excellency, that the beatings whereby we hold our lands are
all valueless. It is written that every man who received such a
beating from the Father of Waterwheels who slow the Emirs, should
instantly begin a lawsuit, because the title to his land is not
valid.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e5992"><!--anchor1--></span>“It is so written. We do not wish lawsuits. We wish to
hold the land as it was given to us after the days of the
Oppression,” they cried.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5996"><!--anchor1--></span>The Governor glanced at the Inspector. This was serious. To cast
doubt on the ownership of land means, in Ethiopia, the letting in
of waters, and the getting out of troops.</p>
<p><span id="d23e5999"><!--anchor1--></span>“Your titles are good,” said the Governor. The
Inspector confirmed with a nod.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6002"><!--anchor1--></span>“Then what is the meaning of these writings which came
from down the river where the Judges are?” Farag’s
uncle waved his copy. “By whose order are we ordered to slay
you, O Excellency Our Governor?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6005"><!--anchor1--></span>“It is not written that you are to slay me.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6008"><!--anchor1--></span>“Not in those very words, but if we leave an earth
unstopped, it is the same as though we wished to save Abu Hussein
from the hounds. These writings say: ‘Abolish your
rulers.’ How can we abolish except we kill? We hear rumours
of one who comes from down the river soon to lead us to
kill.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6011"><!--anchor1--></span>“Fools!” said the Governor. “Your titles are
good. This is madness!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6015"><!--anchor1--></span>“It is so written,” they answered like a pack.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6018"><!--anchor1--></span>“Listen,” said the Inspector smoothly. “I know
who caused the writings to be written and sent. He is a man of a
blue-mottled jowl, in aspect like Bigglebai who ate unclean
matters. He will come up the river and will give tongue about the
beatings.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6021"><!--anchor1--></span>“Will he impeach our land-titles? An evil day for
him!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6024"><!--anchor1--></span>“Go slow, Baker,” the Governor whispered.
“They’ll kill him if they get scared about their
land.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6027"><!--anchor1--></span>“I tell a parable.” The Inspector lit a cigarette.
“Declare which of you took to walk the children of
Milkmaid?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6030"><!--anchor1--></span>“Melik-meid First or Second?” said Farag
quickly.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6034"><!--anchor1--></span>“The second—the one which was lamed by the
thorn.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6037"><!--anchor1--></span>“No—no. Melik-meid the Second strained her shoulder
leaping my water-channel,” a sheikh cried. “Melik-meid
the First was lamed by the thorns on the day when Our Excellency
fell thrice.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6040"><!--anchor1--></span>“True—true. The second Melik-meid’s mate was
Malvolio, the pied hound,” said the Inspector.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6043"><!--anchor1--></span>“I had two of the second Melik-meid’s pups,”
said Farag’s uncle. “They died of the madness in their
ninth month.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6046"><!--anchor1--></span>“And how did they do before they died?” said the
Inspector.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6049"><!--anchor1--></span>“They ran about in the sun, and slavered at the mouth till
they died.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6053"><!--anchor1--></span>“Wherefore?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6056"><!--anchor1--></span>“God knows. He sent the madness. It was no fault of
mine.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6059"><!--anchor1--></span>“Thy own mouth hath answered thee.” The Inspector
laughed. “It is with men as it is with dogs. God afflicts
some with a madness. It is no fault of ours if such men run about
in the sun and froth at the mouth. The man who is coming will emit
spray from his mouth in speaking, and will always edge and push in
towards his hearers. When ye see and hear him ye will understand
that he is afflicted of God: being mad. He is in God’s
hands.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6062"><!--anchor1--></span>“But our titles—are our titles to our lands
good?” the crowd repeated.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6065"><!--anchor1--></span>“Your titles are in my hands—they are good,”
said the Governor.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6068"><!--anchor1--></span>“And he who wrote the writings is an afflicted of
God?” said Farag’s uncle.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6072"><!--anchor1--></span>“The Inspector hath said it,” cried the Governor.
“Ye will see when the man comes. O sheikhs and men, have we
ridden together and walked puppies together, and bought and sold
barley for the horses that after these years we should run riot on
the scent of a madman—an afflicted of God?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6075"><!--anchor1--></span>“But the Hunt pays us to kill mad jackals,” said
Farag’s uncle. “And he who questions my titles to my
land “</p>
<p><span id="d23e6078"><!--anchor1--></span>“Aahh! ’Ware riot!” The Governor’s
hunting-crop cracked like a three-pounder. “By Allah,”
he thundered, “if the afflicted of God come to any harm at
your hands, I myself will shoot every hound and every puppy, and
the Hunt shall ride no more. On your heads be it. Go in peace, and
tell the others.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6081"><!--anchor1--></span>“The Hunt shall ride no more,” said Farag’s
uncle. “Then how can the land be governed? No—no, O
Excellency Our Governor, we will not harm a hair on the head of the
afflicted of God. He shall be to us as is Abu Hussein’s wife
in the breeding season.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6084"><!--anchor1--></span>When they were gone the Governor mopped his forehead.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6087"><!--anchor1--></span>“We must put a few soldiers in every village this
Groombride visits, Baker. Tell ’em to keep out of sight, and
have an eye on the villagers. He’s trying ’em rather
high.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6091"><!--anchor1--></span>“O Excellency,” said the smooth voice of Farag,
laying the <span class="titlem">Field</span> and <span class="titlem">Country Life</span> square on the table, “is
the afflicted of God who resembles Bigglebai one with the man whom
the Inspector met in the great house in England, and to whom he
told the tale of the Mudir’s Cranes?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6100"><!--anchor1--></span>“The same man, Farag,” said the Inspector.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6103"><!--anchor1--></span>“I have often heard the Inspector tell the tale to Our
Excellency at feeding-time in the kennels; but since I am in the
Government service I have never told it to my people. May I loose
that tale among the villages?”</p>

</div><div class="teidiv0" id="index-group.1_text.7_body.1_div.4"><h2>4. 
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</h2>

<p><span id="d23e6114"><!--anchor1--></span>The Governor nodded. “No harm,” said he.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6117"><!--anchor1--></span>The details of Mr. Groombride’s arrival, with his
interpreter, whom he proposed should eat with him at the
Governor’s table, his allocution to the Governor on the New
Movement, and the sins of Imperialism, I purposely omit. At three
in the afternoon Mr. Groombride said: “I will go out now and
address your victims in this village.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6120"><!--anchor1--></span>“Won’t you find it rather hot?” said the
Governor. “They generally take a nap till sunset at this time
of year.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6123"><!--anchor1--></span>Mr. Groombride’s large, loose lips set.
“<em>That</em>,” he replied pointedly, “would be enough to
decide me. I fear you have not quite mastered your instructions.
May I ask you to send for my interpreter? I hope he has not been
tampered with by your subordinates.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6129"><!--anchor1--></span>He was a yellowish boy called Abdul, who had well eaten and
drunk with Farag. The Inspector, by the way, was not present at the
meal.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6133"><!--anchor1--></span>“At whatever risk, I shall go unattended,” said Mr.
Groombride. “Your presence would cow them from giving
evidence. Abdul, my good friend, would you very kindly open the
umbrella?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6136"><!--anchor1--></span>He passed up the gang-plank to the village, and with no more
prelude than a Salvation Army picket in a Portsmouth slum, cried:
“Oh, my brothers!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6139"><!--anchor1--></span>He did not guess how his path had been prepared. The village was
widely awake. Farag, in loose, flowing garments, quite unlike a
kennel huntsman’s khaki and puttees, leaned against the wall
of his uncle’s house. “Come and see the afflicted of
God,” he cried musically, “whose face, indeed,
resembles that of Bigglebai.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6142"><!--anchor1--></span>The village came, and decided that on the whole Farag was
right.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6145"><!--anchor1--></span>“I can’t quite catch what they are saying,”
said Mr. Groombride.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6148"><!--anchor1--></span>“They saying they very much pleased to see you,
Sar,” Adbul interpreted.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6152"><!--anchor1--></span>“Then I do think they might have sent a deputation to the
steamer; but I suppose they were frightened of the officials. Tell
them not to be frightened, Abdul.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6155"><!--anchor1--></span>“He says you are not to be frightened,” Abdul
explained. A child here sputtered with laughter. “Refrain
from mirth,” Farag cried. “The afflicted of God is the
guest of The Excellency Our Governor. We are responsible for every
hair of his head.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6158"><!--anchor1--></span>“He has none,” a voice spoke. “He has the
white and the shining mange.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6161"><!--anchor1--></span>“Now tell them what I have come for, Abdul, and please
keep the umbrella well up. I think I shall reserve myself for my
little vernacular speech at the end.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6164"><!--anchor1--></span>“Approach! Look! Listen!” Abdul chanted. “The
afflicted of God will now make sport. Presently he will speak in
your tongue, and will consume you with mirth. I have been his
servant for three weeks. I will tell you about his undergarments
and his perfumes for his head.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6167"><!--anchor1--></span>He told them at length.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6171"><!--anchor1--></span>“And didst thou take any of his perfume bottles?”
said Farag at the end.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6174"><!--anchor1--></span>“I am his servant. I took two,” Abdul replied.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6177"><!--anchor1--></span>“Ask him,” said Farag’s uncle, “what he
knows about our land-titles. Ye young men are all alike.” He
waved a pamphlet. Mr. Groombride smiled to see how the seed sown in
London had borne fruit by Gihon. Lo! All the seniors held copies of
the pamphlet.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6180"><!--anchor1--></span>“He knows less than a buffalo. He told me on the steamer
that he was driven out of his own land by Demah-Kerazi which is a
devil inhabiting crowds and assemblies,” said Abdul.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6183"><!--anchor1--></span>“Allah between us and evil!” a woman cackled from
the darkness of a hut. “Come in, children, he may have the
Evil Eye.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6186"><!--anchor1--></span>“No, my aunt,” said Farag. “No afflicted of
God has an evil eye. Wait till ye hear his mirth-provoking speech
which he will deliver. I have heard it twice from Abdul.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6190"><!--anchor1--></span>“They seem very quick to grasp the point. How far have you
got, Abdul?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6193"><!--anchor1--></span>“All about the beatings, sar. They are highly
interested.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6196"><!--anchor1--></span>“Don’t forget about the local self-government, and
please hold the umbrella over me. It is hopeless to destroy unless
one first builds up.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6199"><!--anchor1--></span>“He may not have the Evil Eye,” Farag’s uncle
grunted, “but his devil led him too certainly to question my
land-title. Ask him whether he still doubts my
land-title?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6202"><!--anchor1--></span>“Or mine, or mine?” cried the elders.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6205"><!--anchor1--></span>“What odds? He is an afflicted of God,” Farag
called. “Remember the tale I told you.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6209"><!--anchor1--></span>“Yes, but he is an Englishman, and doubtless of influence,
or Our Excellency would not entertain him. Bid the down-country
jackass ask him.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6212"><!--anchor1--></span>“Sar,” said Abdul, “these people, much fearing
they may be turned out of their land in consequence of your
remarks. Therefore they ask you to make promise no bad consequences
following your visit.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6215"><!--anchor1--></span>Mr. Groombride held his breath and turned purple. Then he
stamped his foot.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6218"><!--anchor1--></span>“Tell them,” he cried, “that if a hair of any
one of their heads is touched by any official on any account
whatever, all England shall ring with it. Good God! What callous
oppression! The dark places of the earth are full of
cruelty.” He wiped his face, and throwing out his arms cried:
“Tell them, oh! tell the poor, serfs not to be afraid of me.
Tell them I come to redress their wrongs—not, heaven knows,
to add to their burden.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6221"><!--anchor1--></span>The long-drawn gurgle of the practised public speaker pleased
them much.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6224"><!--anchor1--></span>“That is how the new water-tap runs out in the
kennel,” said Farag. “The Excellency Our Governor
entertains him that he may make sport. Make him say the
mirth-moving speech.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6228"><!--anchor1--></span>“What did he say about my land-titles?”
Farag’s uncle was not to be turned.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6231"><!--anchor1--></span>“He says,” Farag interpreted, “that he
desires, nothing better than that you should live on your lands in
peace. He talks as though he believed himself to be
Governor.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6234"><!--anchor1--></span>“Well. We here are all witnesses to what he has said. Now
go forward with the sport.” Farag’s uncle smoothed his
garments. “How diversely hath Allah made His creatures! On
one He bestows strength to slay Emirs; another He causes to go mad
and wander in the sun, like the afflicted sons of
Melik-meid.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6237"><!--anchor1--></span>“Yes, and to emit spray from the mouth, as the Inspector
told us. All will happen as the Inspector foretold,” said
Farag. “ I have never yet seen the Inspector thrown out
during any run.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6240"><!--anchor1--></span>“I think,” Abdul plucked at Mr. Groombride’s
sleeves, “I think perhaps it is better now, Sar, if you give
your fine little native speech. They not understanding English, but
much pleased at your condescensions.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6243"><!--anchor1--></span>“Condescensions?” Mr. Groombride spun round.
“If they only knew how I felt towards them in my heart! If I
could express a tithe of my feelings! I must stay here and learn
the language. Hold up the umbrella, Abdull I think my little speech
will show them I know something of their <span class="foreign">vie intime</span>.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6250"><!--anchor1--></span>It was a short, simple; carefully learned address, and the
accent, supervised by Abdul on the steamer, allowed the hearers to
guess its meaning, which was a request to see one of the
Mudir’s Cranes; since the desire of the speaker’s life,
the object to which he would consecrate his days, was to improve
the condition of the Mudir’s Cranes. But first he must behold
them with his own eyes. Would, then, his brethren, whom he loved,
show him a Mudir’s Crane whom he desired to love?</p>
<p><span id="d23e6253"><!--anchor1--></span>Once, twice, and again in his peroration he repeated his demand,
using always—that they might see he was acquainted with their
local argot—using always, I say, the word which the Inspector
had given him in England long ago—the short, adhesive word
which, by itself, surprises even unblushing Ethiopia.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6256"><!--anchor1--></span>There are limits to the sublime politeness of an ancient people.
A bulky, blue-chinned man in white clothes, his name red-lettered
across his lower shirtfront, spluttering from under a green-lined
umbrella almost tearful appeals to be introduced to the
Unintroducible; naming loudly the Unnameable; dancing, as it
seemed, in perverse joy at mere mention of the
Unmentionable—found those limits. There was a moment’s
hush, and then such mirth as Gihon through his centuries had never
heard—a roar like to the roar of his own cataracts in flood.
Children cast themselves on the ground, and rolled back and forth
cheering and whooping; strong men, their faces hidden in their
clothes, swayed in silence, till the agony became insupportable,
and they threw up their heads and bayed at the sun; women, mothers
and virgins, shrilled shriek upon mounting shriek, and slapped
their thighs as it might have been the roll of musketry. When they
tried to draw breath, some half-strangled voice would quack out the
word, and the riot began afresh. Last to fall was the city-trained
Abdul. He held on to the edge of apoplexy, then collapsed, throwing
the umbrella from him.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6259"><!--anchor1--></span>Mr. Groombride should not be judged too harshly. Exercise and
strong emotion under a hot sun, the shock of public ingratitude,
for the moment rued his spirit. He furled the umbrella, and with it
beat the prostrate Abdul, crying that he had been betrayed. In
which posture the Inspector, on horseback, followed by the
Governor, suddenly found him.</p>
</div><div class="teidiv0" id="index-group.1_text.7_body.1_div.5"><h2>5. 
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</h2>


<p><span id="d23e6270"><!--anchor1--></span>“That’s all very well,” said the Inspector,
when he had taken Abdul’s dramatically dying depositions on
the steamer, “but you can’t hammer a native merely
because he laughs at you. I see nothing for it but the law to take
its course.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6273"><!--anchor1--></span>“You might reduce the charge to—er—tampering
with an interpreter,” said the Governor. Mr. Groombride was
too far gone to be comforted.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6276"><!--anchor1--></span>“It’s the publicity that I fear,” he wailed.
“Is there no possible means of hushing up the affair? You
don’t know what a question—a single question in the
House means to a man of my position—the ruin of my political
career, I assure you.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6279"><!--anchor1--></span>“I shouldn’t have imagined it,” said the
Governor thoughtfully.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6283"><!--anchor1--></span>“And, though perhaps I ought not to say it, I am not
without honour in my own country—or influence. A word in
season, as you know, Your Excellency. It might carry an official
far.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6286"><!--anchor1--></span>The Governor shuddered.</p>
<p><span id="d23e6289"><!--anchor1--></span>“Yes, that had to come too,” he said to himself.
“Well, look here. If I tell this man of yours to withdraw the
charge against you, you can go to Gehenna for aught I care. The
only condition I make is that if you write—I suppose
that’s part of your business about your travels, you
don’t praise <em>me</em>!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e6295"><!--anchor1--></span>So far Mr. Groombride has loyally adhered to this
understanding.</p>
