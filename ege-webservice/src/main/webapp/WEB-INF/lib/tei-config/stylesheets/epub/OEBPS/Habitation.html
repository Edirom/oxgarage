               without warning, at the very hour his hand was outstretched to
               crumple the Holz and Gunsberg Combine. The New York doctors called
               it overwork, and he lay in a darkened room, one ankle crossed above
               the other, tongue pressed into palate, wondering whether the next
               brain-surge of prickly fires would drive his soul from all
               anchorages. At last they gave judgment. With care he might in two
               years return to the arena, but for the present he must go across
               the water and do no work whatever. He accepted the terms. It was
               capitulation; but the Combine that had shivered beneath his knife
               gave him all the honours of war: Gunsberg himself, full of
               condolences, came to the steamer and filled the Chapins’
               suite of cabins with overwhelming flower-works.

               not been branded by the hells of the past three months. The noise
               of the decks worried him, and he lay down, his tongue only a little
               pressed against his palate.

               sometimes with chance-met gipsies of their own land. From the North
               Cape to the Blue Grotto at Capri they wandered, because the next
               steamer headed that way, or because some one had set them on the
               road. The doctors had warned Sophie that Chapin was not to take
               interest even in other men’s interests; but a familiar
               sensation at the back of the neck after one hour’s keen talk
               with a Nauheimed railway magnate saved her any trouble. He nearly
               wept.

               “D’ you know, in all the six years we’ve been
               married, you’ve never told me what you meant to do with your
               life?”

               now.” Sophie looked up quickly from the Bay of Naples.
               “As far as my business goes, I shall have to live on my rents
               like that architect at San Moritz.”

               till I went to work like the others. Our tradition and upbringing

               introduction, she drove them into that wilderness which is reached
               from an ash-barrel of a station called Charing Cross. They were to
               go to Rockett’s—the farm of one Cloke, in the southern
               counties—where, she assured them, they would meet the genuine
               England of folklore and song.

               and, so far as they could, judge in the bumpy darkness, twice as
               many from a road. Trees, kine, and the outlines of barns showed
               shadowy about them when they alighted, and Mr. and Mrs. Cloke, at
               the open door of a deep stone-floored kitchen, made them shyly
               welcome. They lay in an attic beneath a wavy whitewashed ceiling,
               and, because it rained, a wood fire was made in an iron basket on a
               brick hearth, and they fell asleep to the chirping of mice and the
               whimper of flames.

               “is—what did the hack-cabman say to the railway porter

               bush outside the low window.

               at the circle of still orchard about the half-timbered house.

               and she beckoned in an earnest-eyed hound of engaging manners and
               no engagements, who answered, at times, to the name of Rambler. He
               led them, after breakfast, to the rise behind the house where the
               stile stood against the skyline, and, “I wonder what we shall
               find now,” said Sophie, frankly prancing with joy on the
               grass.

               by clumps of brambles. Gates were not, and the rabbit-mined,
               cattle-rubbed posts leaned out and in. A narrow path doubled among
               the bushes, scores of white tails twinkled before the racing hound,
               and a hawk rose, whistling shrilly.

               hooked by briers. “I thought all England was a garden.
               There’s your spire, George, across the valley. How
               curious!”

               found the ghost of a patch of lucerne that had refused to die:
               there a harsh fallow surrendered to yard-high thistles; and here a
               breadth of rampant kelk feigning to be lawful crop. In the ungrazed
               pastures swaths of dead stuff caught their feet, and the ground
               beneath glistened with sweat. At the bottom of the valley a little
               brook had undermined its footbridge, and frothed in the wreckage.
               But there stood great woods on the slopes beyond—old, tall,
               and brilliant, like unfaded tapestries against the walls of a
               ruined house.

               too.” The, footpath turned the shoulder of a slope, through a
               thicket of rank rhododendrons, and crossed what had once been a
               carriage drive, which ended in the shadow of two gigantic

               some stir it the branches and the flight of four startled magpies;
               there was neither life nor sound about the square house, but it

               for a week they gave the Chapins the official history, as one gives
               it to lodgers, of <strong>Friars Pardon</strong> the house and its five
               farms. But Sophie asked so many questions, and George was so
               humanly interested, that, as confidence in the strangers grew, they
               launched, with observed and acquired detail, into the lives and
               deaths and doings of the Elphicks and the Moones and their
               collaterals, the Haylings and the Torrells. It was a tale told
               serially by Cloke in the barn, or his wife in the dairy, the last
               chapters reserved for the kitchen o’ nights by the big fire,
               when the two had been half the day exploring about the house, where
               old Iggulden, of the blue smock, cackled and chuckled to see them.
               The motives that swayed the characters were beyond their
               comprehension; the fates that shifted them were gods they had never
               met; the sidelights Mrs. Cloke threw on act and incident were more
               amazing than anything in the record. Therefore the Chapins listened
               delightedly, and blessed Mrs. Shonts.

               watched the smokeless chimneys of Friars Pardon slash its roofs
               with shadow, and the smoke of Iggulden’s last lighted fire
               gradually thin and cease. Against her will she fell to wondering
               how many Moones, Elphicks, and Torrells had been swung round the
               turn of the broad Mall stairs. Then she remembered the old
               man’s talk of being “up-ended like a milk-can,”
               and buried her face on Scottie’s neck. At last a
               horse’s feet clinked upon flags, rustled in the old grey
               straw of the rickyard, and she found herself facing the
               vicar—a figure she had seen at church declaiming
               impossibilities (Sophie was a Unitarian) in an unnatural voice.

               The footpaths served all other purposes. And though at first they
               had planned improvements, they had soon fallen in with the customs
               of their hidden kingdom, and moved about the soft-footed ways by
               woodland, hedgerow, and shaw as freely as the rabbits. Indeed, for
               the most part Sophie walked bareheaded beneath her helmet of
               chestnut hair; but she had been plagued of late by vague
               toothaches, which she explained to Mrs. Cloke, who asked some
               questions. How it came about Sophie never knew, but after a while
               behold Mrs. Cloke’s arm was about her waist, and her head was
               on that deep bosom behind the shut kitchen door.

               presently, the shadow passed in a pure wonder and bewilderment that

               Whybarne and a few friends. One of these was a foreigner from the

               most musically drunk at 10.45 p.m. of every Saturday night, as his
               father had done before him, sang no more at the bottom of the
               garden steps, where Sophie always feared he would break his neck.
               The path was undoubtedly an ancient right of way, and at 10.45 p.m.
               on Saturdays Skim remembered it was his duty to posterity to keep
               it open—till Mrs. Cloke spoke to him once. She spoke likewise
               to her daughter Mary, sewing maid at Pardons, and to Mary’s
               best new friend, the five-foot-seven imported London house-maid,
               who taught Mary to trim hats, and found the country dullish.
