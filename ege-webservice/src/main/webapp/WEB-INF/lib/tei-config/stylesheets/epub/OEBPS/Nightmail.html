               <!--anchor1--></span>A NINE O’CLOCK of a gusty winter night I stood on the lower
            stages of one of the G.P.O. outward mail towers. My purpose was a
            run to Quebec in “Postal Packet 162 or such other as may be
            appointed”; and the Postmaster-General himself countersigned
            the order. This talisman opened all doors, even those in the
            despatching-caisson at the foot of the tower, where they were
            delivering the sorted Continental mail. The bags lay packed close
            as herrings in the long grey underbodies which our G.P.O. still
            calls “coaches.” Five such coaches were filled as I
            watched, and were shot up the guides to be locked on to their
            waiting packets three hundred feet nearer the stars.

         <p><span id="d26e2668">
               <!--anchor1--></span>From the despatching-caisson I was conducted by a courteous and
            wonderfully learned official Mr. L.L. Geary, Second Despatcher of
            the Western Route—to the Captains’ Room (this wakes an
            echo of old romance), where the mail captains come on for their
            turn of duty. He introduces me to the captain of
            “162”—Captain Purnall, and his relief, Captain
            Hodgson. The one is small and dark; the other large and red; but
            each has the brooding sheathed glance characteristic of eagles and
            aeronauts. You can see it in the pictures of our racing
            professionals, from L.V. Rautsch to little Ada Warrleigh—that
            fathomless abstraction of eyes habitually turned through naked
            space.

         <p><span id="d26e2672">
               <!--anchor1--></span>On the notice-board in the Captains’ Room, the pulsing
            arrows of some twenty indicators register, degree by geographical
            degree, the progress of as many homeward-bound packets. The word
            “Cape” rises across the face of a dial; a gong strikes:
            the South African mid-weekly mail is in at the Highgate Receiving
            Towers. That is all. It reminds one comically of the traitorous
            little bell which in pigeon-fanciers’, lofts notifies the
            return of a homer.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e2675">
               <!--anchor1--></span>“Time for us to be on the move,” says Captain
            Purnall, and we are shot up by the passenger-lift to the top of the
            despatch-towers. “Our coach will lock on when it is filled
            and the clerks are aboard.”
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e2678">
               <!--anchor1--></span>“No. 162” waits for us in Slip E of the topmost
            stage. The great curve of her back shines frostily under the
            lights, and some minute alteration of trim makes her rock a little
            in her holding-down slips.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e2681">
               <!--anchor1--></span>Captain Purnall frowns and dives inside. Hissing softly,
            “162” comes to rest as level as a rule. From her North
            Atlantic Winter nose-cap (worn bright as diamond with boring
            through uncounted leagues of hail, snow, and ice) to the inset of
            her three built out propeller-shafts is some two hundred and forty
            feet. Her extreme diameter, carried well forward, is thirty-seven.
            Contrast this with the nine hundred by ninety-five of any crack
            liner, and you will realize the power that must drive a hull
            through all weathers at more than the emergency speed of the
            Cyclonic!
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e2684">
               <!--anchor1--></span>The eye detects no joint in her skin plating save the sweeping
            hair-crack of the bow-rudder—Magniac’s rudder that
            assured us the dominion of the unstable air and left its inventor
            penniless and half-blind. It is calculated to Castelli’s
            “gullwing” curve. Raise a few feet of that all but
            invisible plate three-eighths of an inch and she will yaw five
            miles to port or starboard ere she is under control again. Give her
            full helm and she returns on her track like a whip-lash. Cant the
            whole forward—a touch on the wheel will suffice—and she
            sweeps at your good direction up or down. Open the complete circle
            and she presents to the air a mushroom-head that will bring her up
            all standing within a half mile.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e2687">
               <!--anchor1--></span>“Yes,” says Captain Hodgson, answering my thought,
            “Castelli thought he’d discovered the secret of
            controlling aeroplanes when he’d only found out how to steer
            dirigible balloons. Magniac invented his rudder to help war-boats
            ram each other; and war went out of fashion and Magniac he went out
            of his mind because he said he couldn’t serve his country any
            more. I wonder if any of us ever know what we’re really
            doing.”
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e2691">
               <!--anchor1--></span>“If you want to see the coach locked you’d better go
            aboard. It’s due now,” says Mr. Geary. I enter through
            the door amidships. There is nothing here for display. The inner
            skin of the gas-tanks comes down to within a foot or two of my head
            and turns over just short of the turn of the bilges. Liners and
            yachts disguise their tanks with decoration, but the G.P.O. serves
            them raw under a lick of grey official paint. The inner skin shuts
            off fifty feet of the bow and as much of the stern, but the
            bow-bulkhead is recessed for the lift-shunting apparatus as the
            stern is pierced for the shaft-tunnels. The engine-room lies almost
            amidships. Forward of it, extending to the turn of the bow tanks,
            is an aperture—a bottomless hatch at present—into which
            our coach will be locked. One looks down over the coamings three
            hundred feet to the despatching-caisson whence voices boom upward.
            The light below is obscured to a sound of thunder, as our coach
            rises on its guides. It enlarges rapidly from a postage-stamp to a
            playing-card; to a punt and last a pontoon. The two clerks, its
            crew, do not even look up as it comes into place. The Quebec
            letters fly under their fingers and leap into the docketed racks,
            while both captains and Mr. Geary satisfy them selves that the
            coach is locked home. A clerk passes the way-bill over the hatch
            coaming. Captain Purnall thumb-marks and passes it to Mr. Geary.
            Receipt has been given and taken. “Pleasant run,” says
            Mr. Geary, and disappears through the door which a foot high
            pneumatic compressor locks after him.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e2694">
               <!--anchor1--></span>“A-ah!” sighs the compressor released. Our
            holding-down clips part with a tang. We are clear.

         <p><span id="d26e2697">
               <!--anchor1--></span>Captain Hodgson opens the great colloid underbody porthole
            through which I watch over-lighted London slide eastward as the
            gale gets hold of us. The first of the low winter clouds cuts off
            the well-known view and darkens Middlesex. On the south edge of it
            I can see a postal packet’s light ploughing through the white
            fleece. For an instant she gleams like a star ere she drops toward
            the Highgate Receiving Towers. “The Bombay Mail,” says
            Captain Hodgson, and looks at his watch. “She’s forty
            minutes late.”

         <p><span id="d26e2706">
               <!--anchor1--></span>The bridge (let us ever praise the G.P.O. as a repository of
            ancientest tradition!) is represented by a view of Captain
            Hodgson’s legs where he stands on the Control Platform that
            runs thwart-ships overhead. The bow colloid is unshuttered and
            Captain Purnall, one hand on the wheel, is feeling for a fair
            slant. The dial shows 4300 feet. “It’s steep
            to-night,” he mutters, as tier on tier of cloud drops under.
            “We generally pick up an easterly draught below three
            thousand at this time o’ the year. I hate slathering through
            fluff.”
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e2710">
               <!--anchor1--></span>“So does Van Cutsem. Look at him huntin’ for a
            slant!” says Captain Hodgson. A foglight breaks cloud a
            hundred fathoms below. The Antwerp Night Mail makes her signal and
            rises between two racing clouds far to port, her flanks blood-red
            in the glare of Sheerness Double Light. The gale will have us over
            the North Sea in half-an-hour, but Captain Purnall lets her go
            composedly—nosing to every point of the compass as she
            rises.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e2713">
               <!--anchor1--></span>“Five thousand-six, six thousand eight
            hundred”—the dip-dial reads ere we find the easterly
            drift, heralded by a flurry of snow at the thousand fathom level.
            Captain Purnall rings up the engines and keys down the governor on
            the switch before him. There is no sense in urging machinery when
            Eolus himself gives you good knots for nothing. We are away in
            earnest now—our nose notched home on our chosen star. At this
            level the lower clouds are laid out, all neatly combed by the dry
            fingers of the East. Below that again is the strong westerly blow
            through which we rose. Overhead, a film of southerly drifting mist
            draws a theatrical gauze across the firmament. The moonlight turns
            the lower strata to silver without a stain except where our shadow
            underruns us. Bristol and Cardiff Double Lights (those statelily
            inclined beams over Severnmouth) are dead ahead of us; for we keep
            the Southern Winter Route. Coventry Central, the pivot of the
            English system, stabs upward once in ten seconds its spear of
            diamond light to the north; and a point or two off our starboard
            bow The Leek, the great cloud-breaker of Saint David’s Head,
            swings its unmistakable green beam twenty-five degrees each way.
            There must be half a mile of fluff over it in this weather, but it
            does not affect The Leek.

               <!--anchor1--></span>“Our planet’s over-lighted if anything,” says
            Captain Purnall at the wheel, as Cardiff-Bristol slides under.
            “I remember the old days of common white verticals that
            ’ud show two or three hundred feet up in a mist, if you knew
            where to look for ’em. In really fluffy weather they might as
            well have been under your hat. One could get lost coming home then,
            an’ have some fun. Now, it’s like driving down
            Piccadilly.”

            through the cloud-floor. We see nothing of England’s
            outlines: only a white pavement pierced in all directions by these
            manholes of variously coloured fire—Holy Island’s white
            and red—St. Bee’s interrupted white, and so on as far
            as the eye can reach. Blessed be Sargent, Ahrens, and the Dubois
            brothers, who invented the cloud-breakers of the world whereby we
            travel in security!

            Captain Hodgson. Cork Light (green, fixed) enlarges as we rush to
            it. Captain Purnall nods. There is heavy traffic
            hereabouts—the cloud-bank beneath us is streaked. with
            running fissures of flame where the Atlantic boats are hurrying
            Londonward just clear of the fluff. Mail-packets are supposed,
            under the Conference rules, to have the five-thousand-foot lanes to
            themselves, but the foreigner in a hurry is apt to take liberties
            with English air. “No. 162” lifts to a long-drawn wail
            of the breeze in the fore-flange of the rudder and we make Valencia
            (white, green, white) at a safe 7000 feet, dipping our beam to an
            incoming Washington packet.

         <p><span id="d26e2725">
               <!--anchor1--></span>There is no cloud on the Atlantic, and faint streaks of cream
            round Dingle Bay show where the driven seas hammer the coast. A big
            S.A.T.A. liner (<strong>Societe Anonyme des Transports Aeriens</strong>) is
            diving and lifting half a mile below us in search of some break in
            the solid west wind. Lower still lies a disabled Dane she is
            telling the liner all about it in International. Our General
            Communication dial has caught her talk and begins to eavesdrop.
            Captain Hodgson makes a motion to shut it off but checks himself.
            “Perhaps you’d like to listen,” he says.

            boats,” says Captain Hodgson. “Serves ’em right
            for putting German compos in their thrust-blocks. She won’t
            be in Fayal to-night! By the way, wouldn’t you like to look

         <p><span id="d26e2747">
               <!--anchor1--></span>I have been waiting eagerly for this invitation and I follow
            Captain Hodgson from the control-platform, stooping low to avoid
            the bulge of the tanks. We know that Fleury’s gas can lift
            anything, as the world-famous trials of ’89 showed, but its
            almost indefinite powers of expansion necessitate vast tank room.
            Even in this thin air the lift-shunts are busy taking out one-third
            of its normal lift, and still “162” must be checked by
            an occasional downdraw of the rudder or our flight would become a
            climb to the stars. Captain Purnall prefers an overlifted to an
            underlifted ship; but no two captains trim ship alike. “When
            I take the bridge,” says Captain Hodgson, “you’ll
            see me shunt forty per cent of the lift out of the gas and run her
            on the upper rudder. With a swoop upward instead of a swoop
            downward, as you say. Either way will do. It’s only habit.
            Watch our dip-dial! Tim fetches her down once every thirty knots as
            regularly as breathing.”

            arrow creeps from 6700 to 7300. There is the faint
            “szgee” of the rudder, and back slides the arrow to
            6000 on a falling slant of ten or fifteen knots.

            well,” says Captain Hodgson, and, unclipping the jointed bar
            which divides the engine-room from the bare deck, he leads me on to
            the floor. Here we find Fleury’s Paradox of the Bulk-headed
            Vacuum—which we accept now without thought—literally in
            full blast. The three engines are H.T.&amp;T. assisted-vacuo Fleury
            turbines running from 3000 to the Limit—that is to say, up to
            the point when the blades make the air “bell”—cut

            than the old colloid Thelussons, “bell” sooner. The

            the port and starboard turbine vacuum-chambers draw direct into the

               <!--anchor1--></span>The turbines whistle reflectively. From the low-arched
            expansion-tanks on either side the valves descend pillarwise to the
            turbine-chests, and thence the obedient gas whirls through the
            spirals of blades with a force that would whip the teeth out of a
            power saw. Behind, is its own pressure held in leash of spurred on
            by the lift-shunts; before it, the vacuum where Fleury’s Ray
            dances in violet-green bands and whirled turbillons of flame. The
            jointed U-tubes of the vacuum-chamber are pressure-tempered colloid
            (no glass would endure the strain for an instant) and a junior
            engineer with tinted spectacles watches the Ray intently. It is the
            very heart of the machine—a mystery to this day. Even Fleury
            who begat it and, unlike Magniac, died a multi-millionaire, could
            not explain how the restless little imp shuddering in the U-tube
            can, in the fractional fraction of a second, strike the furious
            blast of gas into a chill greyish-green liquid that drains (you can
            hear it trickle) from the far end of the vacuum through the
            eduction-pipes and the mains back to the bilges. Here it returns to
            its gaseous, one had almost written sagacious, state and climbs to
            work afresh. Bilge-tank, upper tank, dorsal-tank,
            expansion-chamber, vacuum, main-return (as a liquid), and
            bilge-tank once more is the ordained cycle. Fleury’s Ray sees
            to that; and the engineer with the tinted spectacles sees to
            Fleury’s Ray. If a speck of oil, if even the natural grease
            of the human finger touch the hooded terminals, Fleury’s Ray
            will wink and disappear and must be laboriously built up again.
            This means half a day’s work for all hands and an expense of,
            one hundred and seventy-odd pounds to the G.P.O. for radium-salts
            and such trifles.

            the precise tip of our nose, pirouettes there an instant, and
            swings off. Our roaring bow sinks as though that light were
            lead—sinks and recovers to lurch and stumble again beneath
            the next blow-out. Tim’s fingers on the lift-shunt strike

                        all quarters come complaints of the unusual prevalence of sleet at
                        the higher levels. Racing planes and digs alike have suffered
                        severely—the former from unequal deposits of half-frozen
                        slush on their vans (and only those who have “held up”
                        a badly balanced plane in a cross-wind know what that means), and
                        the latter from loaded bows and snow-cased bodies. As a
                        consequence, the Northern and North-western upper levels have been
                        practically abandoned, and the high fliers have returned to the
                        ignoble security of the Three, Five, and Six hundred foot levels.
                        But there remain a few undaunted sun-hunters who, in spite of
                        frozen stays and ice-jammed connecting-rods, still haunt the blue
                        empyrean.

                        starters have been conveniently blind to this absurdity, but the
                        public demonstration off St. Catherine’s Light at the Autumn
                        Regattas has borne ample, if tardy, fruit. In the future the
                        “bat” is to be a boat, and the long-unheeded demand of
                        the true sportsman for “no daylight under mid-keel in smooth
                        water” is in a fair way to be conceded. The new rule severely
                        restricts plane area and lift alike. The gas compartments are
                        permitted both fore and aft, as in the old type, but the
                        water-ballast central tank is rendered obligatory. These things
                        work, if not for perfection, at least for the evolution of a sane
                        and wholesome waterborne cruiser. The type of rudder is unaffected
                        by the new rules, so we may expect to see the Long-Davidson make
                        (the patent on which has just expired) come largely into use
                        henceforward, though the strain on the sternpost in turning at
                        speeds over forty miles an hour is admittedly very severe. But
                        bat-boat racing has a great future before it.

                        Monthly Report, is not without humour. Till the 25th October Crete,
                        as all our planet knows, was the sole surviving European repository
                        of “autonomous institutions,” “local
                        self-government,” and the rest of the archaic lumber devised
                        in the past for the confusion of human affairs. She has lived
                        practically on the tourist traffic attracted by her annual pageants
                        of Parliaments, Boards, Municipal Councils, etc., etc. Last summer
                        the islanders grew wearied, as their premier explained, of
                        “playing at being savages for pennies,” and proceeded
                        to pull down all the landing-towers on the island and shut off
                        general communication till such time as the A.B.C. should annex
                        them. For side-splitting comedy we would refer our readers to the
                        correspondence between the Board of Control and the Cretan premier
                        during the “war.” However, all’s well that ends
                        well. The A.B.C. have taken over the administration of Crete on
                        normal lines; and tourists must go elsewhere to witness the
                        “debates,” “resolutions,” and
                        “popular movements” of the old days. The only people to
                        suffer will be the Board of Control, which is grievously overworked
                        already. It is easy enough to condemn the Cretans for their
                        laziness; but when one recalls the large, prosperous, and
                        presumably public-spirited communities which during the last few
                        years have deliberately thrown themselves into the hands of the
                        A.B.C., one, cannot be too hard upon St. Paul’s old

               <h3>2.1. Skylarking on the Equator</h3>
               
               <p><span id="d26e3391">
                     <!--anchor1--></span>To <strong>the Editor</strong>: Only last week, while crossing the Equator
                  (W. 26-15), I became aware of a furious and irregular cannonading
                  some fifteen or twenty knots S. 4 E. Descending to the 500 ft.
                  level, I found a party of Transylvanian tourists engaged in
                  exploding scores of the largest pattern atmospheric bombs (A.B.C.
                  standard) and, in the intervals of their pleasing labours, firing
                  bow and stern smoke-ring swivels. This orgie—I can give it no
                  other name—went on for at least two hours, and naturally
                  produced violent electric derangements. My compasses, of course,
                  were thrown out, my bow was struck twice, and I received two brisk
                  shocks from the lower platform-rail. On remonstrating, I was told
                  that these “professors” were engaged in scientific
                  experiments. The extent of their “scientific”
                  knowledge, may be judged by the fact that they expected to produce
                  (I give their own words) “a little blue sky” if
                  “they went on long enough.” This in the heart of the
                  Doldrums at 450 feet! I have no objection to any amount of blue sky
                  in its proper place (it can be found at the 4000 level for
                  practically twelve months out of the year), but I submit, with all
                  deference to the educational needs of Transylvania, that
                  “skylarking” in the centre of a main-travelled road
                  where, at the best of times, electricity literally drips off
                  one’s stanchions and screw blades, is unnecessary. When my
                  friends had finished, the road was seared, and blown, and pitted
                  with unequal pressure layers, spirals, vortices, and readjustments
                  for at least an hour. I pitched badly twice in an upward
                  rush—solely due to these diabolical throw-downs—that
                  came near to wrecking my propeller. Equatorial work at low levels
                  is trying enough in all conscience without the added terrors of
                  scientific hooliganism in the Doldrums.

                  imperfectly understood. Any overheated motor may of course
                  “seize” without warning; but so many complaints have
                  reached us of accidents similar to yours while shooting the Aurora
                  that we are inclined to believe with Lavalle that the upper strata
                  of the Aurora Borealis are practically one big electric
                  “leak,” and that the paralysis of your engines was due
                  to complete magnetization of all metallic parts. Low-flying planes
                  often “glue up” when near the Magnetic Pole, and there
                  is no reason in science why the same disability should not be
                  experienced at higher levels when the Auroras are
                  “delivering” strongly.

               volumes consecrated to the ground-life of his father, so full of
               the holy intimacies of the domestic hearth. Once returned from the
               abysms of the utter North to that little house upon the outskirts
               of Meudon, it was not the philosopher, the daring observer, the man
               of iron energy that imposed himself on his family, but a fat and
               even plaintive jester, a farceur incarnate and kindly, the co-equal
               of his children, and, it must be written, not seldom the comic
               despair of Madame Lavalle, who, as she writes five years after the
               marriage, to her venerable mother, found “in this unequalled
               intellect whose name I bear the abandon of a large and very untidy
               boy.” Here is her letter:
               ‘“Xavier returned from I do not know where at midnight,
               absorbed in calculations on the eternal question of his
               Aurora—la belle Aurore, whom I begin to hate. Instead of
               anchoring,—I had set out the guide-light above our roof, so
               he had but to descend and fasten the plane—he wandered,
               profoundly distracted, above the town with his anchor down! Figure
               to yourself, dear mother, it is the roof of the mayor’s house
               that the grapnel first engages! That I do not regret, for the
               mayor’s wife and I are not sympathetic; but when Xavier
               uproots my pet araucaria and bears it across the garden into the
               conservatory I protest at the top of my voice. Little Victor in his
               night-clothes runs to the window, enormously amused at the
               parabolic flight without reason, for it is too dark to see the
               grapnel, of my prized tree. The Mayor of Meudon, thunders at our
               door in the name of the Law, demanding, I suppose, my

               life’s work. M. Victor Lavalle tells us of that historic
               collision (en plane) on the flank of Hecla between Herrera, then a
               pillar of the Spanish school, and the man destined to confute his
               theories and lead him intellectually captive. Even through the
               years, the immense laugh of Lavalle as he sustains the
               Spaniard’s wrecked plane, and cries: “Courage! I shall
               not fall till I have found Truth, and I hold you fast!” rings
               like the call of trumpets. This is that Lavalle whom the world,
               immersed in speculations of immediate gain, did not know nor
               suspect—the Lavalle whom they adjudged to the last a pedant
               and a theorist.

               the Tellurionical Records extending over nine years. Of their
               tremendous significance be sure that the modest house at Meudon
               knew as little as that the Records would one day be the
               planet’s standard in all official meteorology. It was enough
               for them that their Xavier—this son, this father, this
               husband—ascended periodically to commune with powers, it
               might be angelic, beyond their comprehension, and that they united
               daily in prayers for his safety.

               impressionable planeur might well have shrunk. He had traced
               through cold and heat, across the deeps of the oceans, with
               instruments of his own invention, over the inhospitable heart of
               the polar ice and the sterile visage of the deserts, league by
               league, patiently, unweariedly, remorselessly, from their
               ever-shifting cradle under the magnetic pole to their exalted
               death-bed in the utmost ether of the upper atmosphere each one of
               the Isoconical Tellurions Lavalle’s Curves, as we call them
               today. He had disentangled the nodes of their intersections,
               assigning to each its regulated period of flux and reflux. Thus
               equipped, he summons Herrera and Tinsley, his pupils, to the final
               demonstration as calmly as though he were ordering his flighter for
               some mid-day journey to Marseilles.
