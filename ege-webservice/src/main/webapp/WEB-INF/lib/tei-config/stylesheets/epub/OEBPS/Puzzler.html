            Minister of Ways and Woodsides in De Thouar’s first
            Administration. Last summer, though he nominally held the same
            portfolio, he was his Colony’s Premier in all but name, and
            the idol of his own province, which is two and a half times the
            size of England. Politically, his creed was his growing country;
            and he came over to England to develop a Great Idea in her behalf.

            not invited to attend; that the local telegraph all but broke down
            beneath the strain of hundred word coded cables; and that I
            practically broke into the house of a stranger to get him
            telephonic facilities on a Sunday, are things I overlook. What I
            objected to was his ingratitude, while I thus tore up England to
            help him. So I said: “Why on earth didn’t you see your
            Opposite Number in Town instead of bringing your office work

               entered we saw that the man was stricken speechless. His eyes grew
               red—red like a ferret’s—and what little breath he

               Shaken as I was (I wanted to get away and laugh) I could not but
               admire the scoundrel’s consummate tact in leading his second
               highest trump. An ass would have introduced Lord Lundie and they
               would not have believed him.

               “Anybody—any father would have done as much, and pray
               don’t apologize your mistake was quite natural.” A
               furniture man sniggered here, and Lord Lundie rolled an Eye of Doom
               on their ranks. “By the way, if you have trouble with these
               persons—they seem to have taken as much as is good for

               “Who’s that real man with the real head?” and we
               hurried after them, for they were running unsteadily, squeaking
               like rabbits as they ran. We overtook them in a little nut wood
               half a mile up the road, where they had turned aside, and were
               rolling. So we rolled with them, and ceased not till we had arrived
               at the extremity of exhaustion.
