            In summer all right-minded boys built huts in the furze-hill behind
            the College—little lairs whittled out of the heart of the prickly
            bushes, full of stumps, odd root-ends, and spikes, but, since they
            were strictly forbidden, palaces of delight. And for the fifth summer
            in succession, Stalky, McTurk, and Beetle (this was before they
            reached the dignity of a study) had built like beavers a place of
            retreat and meditation, where they smoked.

         <p><span id="d26e351">
               <!--anchor1--></span>Now, there was nothing in their characters as known to Mr. Prout,
            their house-master, at all commanding respect; nor did Foxy, the
            subtle red-haired school Sergeant, trust them. His business was to
            wear tennis-shoes, carry binoculars, and swoop hawklike upon evil
            boys. Had he taken the field alone, that hut would have been raided,
            for Foxy knew the manners of his quarry; but Providence moved Mr.
            Prout, whose school-name, derived from the size of his feet, was
            Hoofer, to investigate on his own account; and it was the cautious
            Stalky who found the track of his pugs on the very floor of their
            lair one peaceful afternoon when Stalky would fain have forgotten
            Prout and his works in a volume of Surtees and a new briar-wood pipe.
            Crusoe, at sight of the footprint, did not act more swiftly than
            Stalky. He removed the pipes, swept up all loose match-ends, and
            departed to warn Beetle and McTurk.

         <p><span id="d26e395">
               <!--anchor1--></span>But it was characteristic of the boy that he did not approach his
            allies till he had met and conferred with little Hartopp, President
            of the Natural History Society, an institution which Stalky held in
            contempt, Hartopp was more than surprised when the boy meekly, as he
            knew how, begged to propose himself, Beetle, and McTurk as
            candidates; confessed to a long-smothered interest in
            first-flowerings, early butterflies, and new arrivals, and
            volunteered, if Mr. Hartopp saw fit, to enter on the new life at
            once. Being a master, Hartopp was suspicious; but he was also an
            enthusiast, and his gentle little soul had been galled by chance-heard
            remarks from the three, and specially Beetle. So he was gracious to
            that repentant sinner, and entered the three names in his book.

            house form-room.  They were stowing away books for a quiet afternoon
            in the furze, which they called the ‘wuzzy.’

            volumes with which his chest was cased. The boys carried their
            libraries between their belt and their collar. ‘Nice job! This means
            we're under suspicion for the rest of the term.’

            Hartopp. 'Told him that you'd read papers to the Bug-hunters if he'd

            slide. ‘'Gives one no end of a professional air, I think. Here's Clay

            the cliffs under the furze-hills, crossing combe after gorzy combe.

            all that Turkey said of geology was utterly unquotable.

            themselves down on the short, springy turf between the drone of the
            sea below and the light summer wind among the inland trees. They were
            looking into a combe half full of old, high furze in gay bloom that
            ran up to a fringe of brambles and a dense wood of mixed timber and
            hollies. It was as though one-half the combe were filled with golden
            fire to the cliff's edge. The side nearest to them was open grass,
            and fairly bristled with notice-boards.

            the handle to a two-foot stave, and slid the cane-ring round his
            waist. Stalky led inland to the wood, which was, perhaps, a quarter
            of a mile from the sea, and reached the fringe of the brambles.

            pinched him <em>a tergo</em>. Down that tunnel they crawled. It was
            evidently a highway for the inhabitants of the combe; and, to their
            inexpressible joy, ended, at the very edge of the cliff, in a few
            square feet of dry turf walled and roofed with impenetrable gorse.

            squawking on the ledges, the hiss and jabber of a nest of hawks
            somewhere out of sight; and, with great deliberation, Stalky spat on
            to the back of a young rabbit sunning himself far down where only a
            cliff-rabbit could have found foot-hold. Great gray and black gulls
            screamed against the jackdaws; the heavy-scented acres of bloom round
            them were alive with low-nesting birds, singing or silent as the
            shadow of the wheeling hawks passed and returned; and on the naked
            turf across the combe rabbits thumped and frolicked.

            but exceptions prove the rule. And a vixen, too!’ They were fed on
            the terrace by a gray-haired housekeeper. Stalky and Beetle merely
            ate, but McTurk with bright eyes continued a free and lofty
            discourse; and ever the old gentleman treated him as a brother.
