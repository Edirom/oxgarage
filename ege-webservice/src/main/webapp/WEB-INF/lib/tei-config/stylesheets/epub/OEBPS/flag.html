            It was winter and bitter cold of mornings. Consequently Stalky and
            Beetle—McTurk being of the offensive type that makes ornate toilet
            under all circumstances—drowsed till the last moment before turning
            out to call-over in the gas-lit gymnasium. It followed that they were
            often late; and since every unpunctuality earned them a black mark,
            and since three black marks a week meant defaulters' drill, equally
            it followed that they spent hours under the Sergeant's hand. Foxy
            drilled the defaulters with all the pomp of his old parade-ground.
            ‘Don't think it's any pleasure to me’ (his introduction never
            varied). ‘I'd much sooner be smoking a quiet pipe in my own
            quarters—but I see we 'ave the Old Brigade on our 'ands this
            afternoon. If I only 'ad you regular, Muster Corkran,’ said he,
            dressing the line.

               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Not <em>quite</em> so previous, please. I'm taking this
            drill. Left, half—turn!  Slow—march.’ Twenty-five
            sluggards, all old offenders, filed into the gymnasium.
            ‘Quietly provide yourselves with the requisite dumb-bells;
            returnin' quietly to your place. Number off from the right, in a low
            voice. Odd numbers one pace to the front.  Even numbers stand
            fast. Now, leanin' forward from the 'ips, takin' your time from

            lightened by a murmur from the rear rank that the old gentleman was
            General Collinson, a member of the College Board of Council.
         </p>

               <!--anchor1--></span>The wheel was faced about, flung back, broken into fours, and restored
            to line without a falter. The official hour of punishment was long
            passed, but no one thought of that. They were backing up
            Stalky—Stalky in deadly fear lest his voice should crack.

            a cadet-corps in the College.’

               <!--anchor1--></span>‘But aren't they keen on it?’ said McTurk, speaking for the first
            time, with a twinkle in his deep-set eyes.

         <p><span id="d26e10687">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘But you should have a cadet-corps.’ The General pursued his own line
            of thought.  ‘You <em>shall</em> have a cadet-corps, too, if my
            recommendation in Council is any use. I don't know when I've been so
            pleased. Boys animated by a spirit like yours should set an example
            to the whole school.’

            me, Willy? Who was that boy who took the drill?’

            depth of winter; but grown people, especially those who have lived
            long in foreign parts, make these little errors, and McTurk did not

            Naturally, General Collinson was delighted and told his friends. One
            of his friends rejoiced in a friend, a Member of Parliament—a
            zealous, an intelligent, and, above all, a patriotic person, anxious
            to do the most good in the shortest possible time. But we cannot
            answer, alas! for the friends of our friends. If Collinson's friend
            had introduced him to the General, the latter would have taken his
            measure and saved much. But the friend merely spoke of his friend;
            and since no two people in the world see eye to eye, the picture
            conveyed to Collinson was inaccurate. Moreover, the man was an M.P.,
            an impeccable Conservative, and the General had the English soldier's
            lurking respect for any member of the Court of Last Appeal. He was
            going down into the West country, to spread light in somebody's
            benighted constituency. Wouldn't it be a good idea if, armed with the
            General's recommendation, he, taking the admirable and newly
            established cadet-corps for his text, spoke a few words—‘Just talked

            acceptable; and he'd be the very man to do it. The sort of talk that

            discourse, and a ring of chairs for the masters.

            amid applause. When Mr. Martin took the applause to himself, they
            naturally applauded more than ever. It was some time before be could
            begin. He had no knowledge of the school—its tradition or heritage.
            He did not know that the last census showed that eighty per cent. of
            the boys had been born abroad—in camp, cantonment, or upon the high
            seas; or that seventy-five per cent. were sons of officers in one or
            other of the services—Willoughbys, Paulets, De Castros, Maynes,
            Randalls, after their kind—looking to follow their fathers'
            profession. The Head might have told him this, and much more; but,
            after an hour-long dinner in his company, the Head decided to say
            nothing whatever. Mr. Raymond Martin seemed to know so much already.

            that, though they were not conscious of it, set every young nerve
            ajar. He supposed they knew—hey?—what he had come down for? It was
            not often that he had an opportunity to talk to boys. He supposed
            that boys were very much the same kind of persons—some people
            thought them rather funny persons—as they had been in his youth.

            life that was opening before them. Life was not all—he enumerated a
            few games, and, that nothing might be lacking to the sweep and impact
            of his fall, added ‘marbles.’ ‘Yes, life was not,’ he said, ‘all

            pale of toleration—self-damned before all men. Stalky bowed his head

            regiment, and he was glad to learn that they had established a
            volunteer corps in their midst. The establishment of such an
            establishment conduced to a proper and healthy spirit, which, if
            fostered, would be of great benefit to the land they loved and were
            so proud to belong to. Some of those now present expected, he had no
            doubt—some of them anxiously looked forward to leading their men

            them under the well-intentioned feet of eloquence. In a raucous
            voice, he cried aloud little matters, like the hope of Honor and the
            dream of Glory, that boys do not discuss even with their most
            intimate equals, cheerfully assuming that, till he spoke, they had
            never considered these possibilities. He pointed them to shining
            goals, with fingers which smudged out all radiance on all horizons.
            He profaned the most secret places of their souls with outcries and
            gesticulations, he bade them consider the deeds of their ancestors in
            such a fashion that they were flushed to their tingling ears. Some of
            them—the rending voice cut a frozen stillness—might have had
            relatives who perished in defence of their country. They thought, not
            a few of them, of an old sword in a passage, or above a
            breakfast-room table, seen and fingered by stealth since they could
            walk. He adjured them to emulate those illustrious examples; and they
            looked all ways in their extreme discomfort.

            sat, flushed and uneasy, in sour disgust. After many, many words, he
            reached for the cloth-wrapped stick and thrust one hand in his bosom.
            This—this was the concrete symbol of their land—worthy of all honor
            and reverence! Let no boy look on this flag who did not purpose to
            worthily add to its imperishable lustre. He shook it before them—a
            large calico Union Jack, staring in all three colors, and waited for
            the thunder of applause that should crown his effort.

            Golf-club, and in Keyte's window, where a certain kind of striped
            sweetmeat bore it in paper on each box. But the College never
            displayed it; it was no part of the scheme of their lives; the Head
            had never alluded to it; their fathers had not declared it unto them.
            It was a matter shut up, sacred and apart. What, in the name of
            everything caddish, was he driving at, who waved that horror before
            their eyes? Happy thought! Perhaps he was drunk.

            ‘Rummy thing!’ said Beetle to McTurk. ‘I was in the study, doin' a

            came in, an' I said 'Hullo!' an' he cursed me like a bargee, and then
            he began to blub like anything. Shoved his head on the table and
            howled. Hadn't we better do something?’
