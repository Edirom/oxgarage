               <!--anchor1--></span>It was within a few days of the holidays, the term-end examinations,
            and, more important still, the issue of the College paper which
            Beetle edited. He had been cajoled into that office by the
            blandishments of Stalky and McTurk and the extreme rigor of study
            law. Once installed, he discovered, as others have done before him,
            that his duty was to do the work while his friends criticized. Stalky
            christened it the ‘Swillingford Patriot,’ in pious memory of
            Sponge—and McTurk compared the output unfavorably with Ruskin and De
            Quincey. Only the Head took an interest in the publication, and his
            methods were peculiar. He gave Beetle the run of his brown-bound,
            tobacco-scented library; prohibiting nothing, recommending nothing.
            There Beetle found a fat arm-chair, a silver inkstand, and unlimited
            pens and paper.  There were scores and scores of ancient dramatists;
            there were Hakluyt, his voyages; French translations of Muscovite
            authors called Pushkin and Lermontoff; little tales of a heady and
            bewildering nature, interspersed with unusual songs—Peacock was that
            writer's name; there was Borrow's ‘Lavengro‘; an odd theme, purporting
            to be a translation of something, called a ‘Ruba'iyat,’ which the
            Head said was a poem not yet come to its own; there were hundreds of
            volumes of verse—-Crashaw; Dryden; Alexander Smith; L. E. L.; Lydia
            Sigourney; Fletcher and a purple island; Donne; Marlowe's ‘Faust ‘;
            and—this made McTurk (to whom Beetle conveyed it) sheer drunk for
            three days—Ossian; ‘The Earthly Paradise‘; ‘Atalanta in Calydon‘;
            and Rossetti—to name only a few. Then the Head, drifting in under
            pretense of playing censor to the paper, would read here a verse and
            here another of these poets, opening up avenues. And, slow breathing,
            with half-shut eyes above his cigar, would he speak of great men
            living, and journals, long dead, founded in their riotous youth; of
            years when all the planets were little new-lit stars trying to find
            their places in the uncaring void, and he, the Head, knew them as
            young men know one another. So the regular work went to the dogs,
            Beetle being full of other matters and meters, hoarded in secret and
            only told to McTurk of an afternoon, on the sands, walking high and
            disposedly round the wreck of the Armada galleons, shouting and
            declaiming against the long-ridged seas.

               <!--anchor1--></span>Thanks in large part to their house-master's experienced distrust, the
            three for three consecutive terms had been passed over for promotion
            to the rank of prefect—an office that went by merit, and carried
            with it the honor of the ground-ash, and liberty, under restrictions,
            to use it.

               <!--anchor1--></span>’<em>But</em>,’ said Stalky, ‘come to think of it, we've done more giddy
            jesting with the Sixth since we've been passed over than any one else
            in the last seven years.’
         </p>

               <!--anchor1--></span>He touched his neck proudly. It was encircled by the stiffest of
            stick-up collars, which custom decreed could be worn only by the
            Sixth. And the Sixth saw those collars and said no word. ‘Pussy,‘
            Abanazar, or Dick Four of a year ago would have seen them discarded
            in five minutes or... But the Sixth of that term was made up mostly
            of young but brilliantly clever boys, pets of the house-masters, too
            anxious for their dignity to care to come to open odds with the
            resourceful three. So they crammed their caps at the extreme back of
            their heads, instead of a trifle over one eye as the Fifth should,
            and rejoiced in patent-leather boots on week-days, and marvellous
            made-up ties on Sundays—no man rebuking. McTurk was going up for
            Cooper's Hill, and Stalky for Sandhurst, in the spring; and the Head
            had told them both that, unless they absolutely collapsed during the
            holidays, they were safe. As a trainer of colts, the Head seldom
            erred in an estimate of form.

            one word of which did Beetle remember when he dashed up to the study,
            white with excitement, and poured out the wondrous tale. It demanded
            a great belief.

            breaking me in for this for ever so long, and I never knew—I never
            knew. One don't begin with writing straight off, y'know. Begin by
            filling in telegrams and cutting things out o' papers with scissors.’

            dearly beloved 'earers—though not prefects.’

            that if I were more reasonable—yah!—I might be a prefect next

            want to correct the 'Swillingford Patriot.'’

            also unluckily did King, who never passed without witticisms. But
            brigades of Kings could not have ruffled Beetle that day.

            face to face with Tulke, senior prefect of King's house—a smallish,
            white-haired boy, of the type that must be promoted on account of its
            intellect, and ever afterwards appeals to the Head to support its
            authority when zeal has outrun discretion.

            authority, and, instead of beginning dictation at once, delivered a
            lecture on the spirit in which examinations should be approached. As
            the storm subsided, Beetle fanned it afresh.

            during which the prefects showed unmistakable signs of boredom.

            unscholarly middle classes,' 'lust for mere marks,' and all the rest.
