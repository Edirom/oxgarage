            There was no disguising the defeat. The victory was to Prout, but they
            grudged it not. If he had broken the rules of the game by calling in
            the Head, they had had a good run for their money.

               <!--anchor1--></span>The Reverend John sought the earliest opportunity of talking things
            over. Members of a bachelor Common-room, of a school where masters'
            studies are designedly dotted among studies and form-rooms, can, if
            they choose, see a great deal of their charges. Number Five had spent
            some cautious years in testing the Reverend John. He was emphatically
            a gentleman. He knocked at a study door before entering; he comported
            himself as a visitor and not a strayed lictor; he never prosed, and
            he never carried over into official life the confidences of idle
            hours. Prout was ever an unmitigated nuisance; King came solely as an
            avenger of blood; even little Hartopp, talking natural history,
            seldom forgot his office; but the Reverend John was a guest desired
            and beloved by Number Five.

               <!--anchor1--></span>Behold him, then, in their only arm-chair, a bent briar between his
            teeth, chin down in three folds on his clerical collar, and blowing
            like an amiable whale, while Number Five discoursed of life as it
            appeared to them, and specially of that last interview with the
            Head—in the matter of usury.

            said, twinkling and shaking all over; ‘and, as you say, you were
            entirely in the right.’

               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Ra-ather, Padre! We could have proved it if he'd let us talk,’ said
            Stalky; ‘but he didn't. The Head's a downy bird.’

         <p><span id="d26e7440">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘He understands you perfectly. Ho! ho! Well, you worked hard enough
            for it.’

         <p><span id="d26e7443">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘But he's awfully fair. He doesn't lick a chap in the morning an'
            preach at him in the afternoon,’ said Beetle.

               <!--anchor1--></span>‘He can't; he ain't in Orders, thank goodness,’ said McTurk. Number
            Five held the very strongest views on clerical head-masters, and were
            ever ready to meet their pastor in argument.

            gently.

         <p><span id="d26e7458">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘It isn't fair on the chaps,’ Stalky replied. ‘Makes 'em sulky. Of
            course it's different with you, sir. You belong to the school—same
            as we do. I mean ordinary clergymen.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7465">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Well, I am a most ordinary clergyman; and Mr. Hartopp's in Orders,
            too.’

         <p><span id="d26e7471">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Ye—es, but he took 'em after he came to the Coll. We saw him go up
            for his exam.  That's all right,’ said Beetle. ‘But just think if the
            Head went and got ordained!’

         <p><span id="d26e7477">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘What would happen, Beetle?’

         <p><span id="d26e7483">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Oh, the Coll. 'ud go to pieces in a year, sir. There's no doubt o'
            that.’

         <p><span id="d26e7486">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘How d'you know?’ The Reverend John was smiling.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7489">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘We've been here nearly six years now. There are precious few things
            about the Coll.  we don't know,’ Stalky replied. ‘Why, even you came
            the term after I did, sir. I remember your asking our names in form
            your first lesson. Mr. King, Mr. Prout, and the Head, of course, are
            the only masters senior to us—in that way.’

         <p><span id="d26e7499">

         <p><span id="d26e7502">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Huh!’ said Beetle with a grunt. ‘They came here, an' they went away
            to get married.  Jolly good riddance, too!’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7508">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Doesn't our Beetle hold with matrimony?’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7514">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘No, Padre; don't make fun of me. I've met chaps in the holidays
            who've got married house-masters. It's perfectly awful! They have
            babies and teething and measles and all that sort of thing right bung
            <em>in</em> the school; and the masters' wives give
            tea-parties—tea-parties, Padre!—and ask the chaps to breakfast.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7520">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘That don't matter so much,’ said Stalky. ‘But the house-masters let
            their houses alone, and they leave everything to the prefects. Why,
            in one school, a chap told me, there were big baize doors and a
            passage about a mile long between the house and the master's house.
            They could do just what they pleased.’
         </p>

         <p><span id="d26e7530">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Oh, larks are right enough; but you know what we mean, Padre. After a
            bit it gets worse an' worse. Then there's a big bust-up and a row
            that gets into the papers, and a lot of chaps are expelled, you
            know.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7533">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Always the wrong un's; don't forget that. Have a cup of cocoa,
            Padre?’ said McTurk with the kettle.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7539">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘No, thanks; I'm smoking. Always the wrong 'uns? Pro-ceed, my
            Stalky.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7545">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘And then‘—Stalky warmed to the work—‘everybody says, 'Who'd ha'
            thought it?  Shock-in' boys! Wicked little kids!' It all comes of
            havin' married house-masters, <em>I</em> think.’
         </p>

         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7560">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘But it does,’ McTurk interrupted. ‘I've met chaps in the holidays,
            an' they've told me the same thing. It looks awfully pretty for one's
            people to see—a nice separate house with a nice lady in charge, an'
            all that. But it isn't. It takes the house-masters off their work,
            and it gives the prefects a heap too much power, an'—an'—it rots up
            everything. You see, it isn't as if we were just an ordinary school.
            We take crammers' rejections as well as good little boys like Stalky.
            We've got to do that to make our name, of course, and we get 'em into
            Sandhurst somehow or other, don't we?’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7570">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘True, O Turk. Like a book thou talkest, Turkey.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7576">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘And so we want rather different masters, don't you think so, to other
            places? We aren't like the rest of the schools.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7579">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘It leads to all sorts of bullyin', too, a chap told me,’ said
            Beetle.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7585">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Well, you <em>do</em> need most of a single man's time, I must say.’ The
            Reverend John considered his hosts critically. ‘But do you never feel
            that the world—the Common-room—is too much with you sometimes?’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7591">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Not exactly—in summer, anyhow.’ Stalky's eye roved contentedly to
            the window. ‘Our bounds are pretty big, too, and they leave us to
            ourselves a good deal.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7597">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘For example, here am I sitting in your study, very much in your way,
            eh?’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7601">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Indeed you aren't, Padre. Sit down. Don't go, sir. You know we're
            glad whenever you come.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7604">
               <!--anchor1--></span>There was no doubting the sincerity of the voices. The Reverend John
            flushed a little with pleasure and refilled his briar.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7607">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘And we generally know where the Common-room are,’ said Beetle
            triumphantly. ‘Didn't you come through our lower dormitories last
            night after ten, sir?’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7613">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘I went to smoke a pipe with your house-master. No, I didn't give him
            any impressions. I took a short cut through your dormitories.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7616">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘I sniffed a whiff of 'baccy, this mornin'. Yours is stronger than Mr.
            Prout's. <em>I</em> knew,’ said Beetle, wagging his head.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7628">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Good heavens!’ said the Reverend John absently. It was some years
            before Beetle perceived that this was rather a tribute to innocence
            than observation. The long, light, blindless dormitories, devoid of
            inner doors, were crossed at all hours of the night by masters
            visiting one another; for bachelors sit up later than married folk.
            Beetle had never dreamed that there might be a purpose in this steady
            policing.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7638">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Talking about bullying,’ the Reverend John resumed, ‘you all caught
            it pretty hot when you were fags, didn't you?’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7641">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Well, we must have been rather awful little beasts,’ said Beetle,
            looking serenely over the gulf between eleven and sixteen. ‘My Hat,
            what bullies they were then—Fairburn, 'Gobby' Maunsell, and all
            that gang!’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7653">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘'Member when 'Gobby' called us the Three Blind Mice, and we had to
            get up on the lockers and sing while he buzzed inkpots at us?’ said
            Stalky. ‘They <em>were</em> bullies if you like!’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7662">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘But there isn't any of it now,’ said McTurk soothingly.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7668">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘That's where you make a mistake. We're all inclined to say that
            everything is all right as long we aren't ourselves hurt. I sometimes
            wonder if it is extinct—bullying.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7671">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Fags bully each other horrid; but the upper forms are supposed to be
            swottin' for exams. They've got something else to think about,’ said
            Beetle.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7678">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Why? What do you think?’ Stalky was watching the chaplain's face.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7684">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘I have my doubts.’ Then, explosively, ‘On my word, for three
            moderately intelligent boys you aren't very observant. I suppose you
            were too busy making things warm for your house-master to see what
            lay under your noses when you were in the form-rooms last week?’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7687">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘What, sir? I—I swear we didn't see anything,’ said Beetle.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7693">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Then I'd advise you to look. When a little chap is whimpering in a
            corner and wears his clothes like rags, and never does any work, and
            is notoriously the dirtiest little 'corridor-caution' in the Coll.,
            something's wrong somewhere.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7696">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘That's Clewer,’ said McTurk under his breath.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7705">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Yes, Clewer. He comes to me for his French. It's his first term, and
            he's almost as complete a wreck as you were, Beetle. He's not
            naturally clever, but he has been hammered till he's nearly an
            idiot.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e7715">

            school.  Sefton had spent three months with a London crammer, and the
            tale of his adventures there lost nothing in the telling. Campbell,
            who had a fine taste in clothes and a fluent vocabulary, followed his
            lead in looking down loftily on the rest of the world. This was only
            their second term, and the school, used to what it profanely called

            their whiskers—Sefton owned a real razor—and their mustaches were
