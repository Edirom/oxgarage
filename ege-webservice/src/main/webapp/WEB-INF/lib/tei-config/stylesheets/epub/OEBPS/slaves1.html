            The music-room on the top floor of Number Five was filled with the
            ‘Aladdin’ company at rehearsal. Dickson Quartus, commonly known as
            Dick Four, was Aladdin, stage-manager, ballet-master, half the
            orchestra, and largely librettist, for the ‘book’ had been rewritten
            and filled with local allusions. The pantomime was to be given next
            week, in the down-stairs study occupied by Aladdin, Abanazar, and the
            Emperor of China. The Slave of the Lamp, with the Princess
            Badroulbadour and the Widow Twankay, owned Number Five study across
            the same landing, so that the company could be easily assembled. The
            floor shook to the stamp-and-go of the ballet, while Aladdin, in pink
            cotton tights, a blue and tinsel jacket, and a plumed hat, banged
            alternately on the piano and his banjo. He was the moving spirit of
            the game, as befitted a senior who had passed his Army Preliminary
            and hoped to enter Sandhurst next spring.

            the Widow Twankay danced her dance, and the company decided it would
            ‘come all right on the night.’

               <!--anchor1--></span>‘What about the last song, though?’ said the Emperor, a tallish,
            fair-headed boy with a ghost of a mustache, at which he pulled
            manfully. ‘We need a rousing old tune.’

               <!--anchor1--></span>‘'John Peel'? 'Drink, Puppy, Drink'?’ suggested Abanazar, smoothing
            his baggy lilac pajamas. ‘Pussy’ Abanazar never looked more than
            one-half awake, but he owned a soft, slow smile which well suited the
            part of the Wicked Uncle.

            silk half-mask on his forehead, whistled lazily where he lay on the

            on the night.  We must work it with the banjoes—play an' dance at
            the same time. You try, Tertius.’

         <p><span id="d26e2399">
               <!--anchor1--></span>The Emperor pushed aside his pea-green sleeves of state, and followed
            Dick Four on a heavy nickel plated banjo.

         <p><span id="d26e2408">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Oh, that's Beetle's biznai,’ said Dick Four. ‘Vamp it up, Beetle.
            Don't keep us waiting all night. You've got to get Pussy out of the
            light somehow, and bring us all in dancin' at the end.’

         <p><span id="d26e2417">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘All right. You two play it again,’ said Beetle, who, in a gray skirt
            and a wig of chestnut sausage-curls, set slantwise above a pair of
            spectacles mended with an old boot-lace, represented the Widow
            Twankay. He waved one leg in time to the hammered refrain, and the
            banjoes grew louder.

               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Um! Ah! Er—'Aladdin now has won his wife,'’ he sang, and Dick Four
            repeated it.

         <p><span id="d26e2429">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘'Your Emperor is appeased.'’ Tertius flung out his chest as he
            delivered his line.

            It's four kicks and a turn,’ said Dick Four.

         <p><span id="d26e2457">
               <!--anchor1--></span>McTurk, in a violet silk skirt and a coquettish blue turban, slouched
            forward as one thoroughly ashamed of himself. The Slave of the Lamp
            climbed down from the piano, and dispassionately kicked him. ‘Play
            up, Turkey,’ he said; ‘this is serious.’ But there fell on the door
            the knock of authority. It happened to be King, in gown and
            mortar-board, enjoying a Saturday evening prowl before dinner.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e2466">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Locked doors! Locked doors!’ he snapped with a scowl. ‘What's the
            meaning of this; and what, may I ask, is the intention of this—this
            epicene attire?’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e2469">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Pantomime, sir. The Head gave us leave,’ said Abanazar, as the only
            member of the Sixth concerned. Dick Four stood firm in the confidence
            born of well-fitting tights, but Beetle strove to efface himself
            behind the piano. A gray princess-skirt borrowed from a day-boy's
            mother and a spotted cotton bodice unsystematically padded with
            imposition-paper make one ridiculous. And in other regards Beetle had
            a bad conscience.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e2481">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘As usual!’ sneered King.  ‘Futile foolery just when your careers, such
            as they may be, are hanging in the balance. I see! Ah, I see! The old
            gang of criminals—allied forces of disorder—Corkran‘—the Slave of
            the Lamp smiled politely—‘McTurk‘—the Irishman scowled—‘and, of
            course, the unspeakable Beetle, our friend Gigadibs.’ Abanazar, the
            Emperor, and Aladdin had more or less of characters, and King passed
            them over. ‘Come forth, my inky buffoon, from behind yonder instrument
            of music! You supply, I presume, the doggerel for this entertainment.
            Esteem yourself to be, as it were, a poet?’

         <p><span id="d26e2509">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘He's found one of 'em,’ thought Beetle, noting the flush on King's
            cheek-bone.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e2515">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘I have just had the pleasure of reading an effusion of yours to my
            address, I believe—an effusion intended to rhyme. So—so you despise
            me, Master Gigadibs, do you? I am quite aware—you need not explain
            —that it was ostensibly not intended for my edification. I read it
            with laughter—yes, with laughter. These paper pellets of inky boys
            —still a boy we are, Master Gigadibs—do not disturb my equanimity.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e2524">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Wonder which it was,’ thought Beetle. He had launched many lampoons
            on an appreciative public ever since he discovered that it was
            possible to convey reproof in rhyme.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e2531">
               <!--anchor1--></span>In sign of his unruffled calm, King proceeded to tear Beetle, whom he
            called Gigadibs, slowly asunder. From his untied shoestrings to his
            mended spectacles (the life of a poet at a big school is hard) he
            held him up to the derision of his associates—with the usual result.
            His wild flowers of speech—King had an unpleasant tongue—-restored
            him to good humor at the last. He drew a lurid picture of Beetle's
            latter end as a scurrilous pamphleteer dying in an attic, scattered a
            few compliments over McTurk and Corkran, and, reminding Beetle that he
            must come up for judgment when called upon, went to Common-room,
            where he triumphed anew over his victims.

               <!--anchor1--></span>‘And the worst of it,’ he explained in a loud voice over his soup, ‘is
            that I waste such gems of sarcasm on their thick heads. It's miles
            above them, I'm certain.’

               <!--anchor1--></span>‘We-ell,’ said the school chaplain slowly, ‘I don't know what
            Corkran's appreciation of your style may be, but young McTurk reads
            Ruskin for his amusement.’

               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Dunno,’ said Beetle, struggling out of the skirt. ‘There was one
            about his hunting for popularity with the small boys, and the other
            one was one about him in hell, tellin' the Devil he was a Balliol
            man. I swear both of 'em rhymed all right. By gum! P'raps Manders

            white boy in a form-room next door to King's study, which, again, was
            immediately below his own, and chased him up the corridor into a
            form-room sacred to the revels of the Lower Third. Thence he came
            back, greatly disordered, to find McTurk, Stalky, and the others of
            the company, in his study enjoying an unlimited ‘brew‘—coffee,
            cocoa, buns, new bread hot and steaming, sardine, sausage,
            ham-and-tongue paste, pilchards, three jams, and at least as many
            pounds of Devonshire cream.

            starvation had reigned in the studies for weeks.

            prospect of revenge. He would embody the suggestion about the nose in
            deathless verse. King threw up the window, and sternly rebuked

            Beetle made zealous feint to stop it, and in that endeavor overturned
            a student's lamp, which dripped, <em>via</em> King's papers and some choice
            books, greasily on to a Persian rug. There was much broken glass on

            gum-bottle, unstoppered, had rolled semicircularly across the floor;
            and in what manner the white china door-knob grew to be painted with
            yet more of Manders's young blood, were matters which Beetle did not

            through a sea of lather. ‘Ink and blood all mixed. I held the little
            beast's head all over the Latin proses for Monday. Golly, how the oil
            stunk! And Rabbits-Eggs told King to poultice his nose! Did you hit
            Rabbits-Eggs, Stalky?’

            when he heard that the musk basket was broken, and, moreover, Beetle
            retailed all King's language with emendations and purple insets.

            half-hitched trousers.  ‘So dam' bad, too, for innocent boys like us!
            Wonder what they'd say at 'St.  Winifred's, or the World of
            School.'—By gum! That reminds me we owe the Lower Third one for
            assaultin' Beetle when he chivied Manders minor. Come on! It's an
            alibi, Samivel; and, besides, if we let 'em off they'll be worse next

               <!--anchor1--></span>The Lower Third had set a guard upon their form-room for the space of
            a full hour, which to a boy is a lifetime. Now they were busy with
            their Saturday evening businesses—cooking sparrows over the gas with
            rusty nibs; brewing unholy drinks in gallipots; skinning moles with
            pocket-knives; attending to paper trays full of silkworms, or
            discussing the iniquities of their elders with a freedom, fluency,
            and point that would have amazed their parents. The blow fell without
            warning. Stalky upset a form crowded with small boys among their own
            cooking utensils, McTurk raided the untidy lockers as a terrier digs
            at a rabbit-hole, while Beetle poured ink upon such heads as he could
            not appeal to with a Smith's Classical Dictionary. Three brisk
            minutes accounted for many silkworms, pet larvae, French exercises,
            school caps, half-prepared bones and skulls, and a dozen pots of
            home-made sloe jam. It was a great wreckage, and the form-room looked
            as though three conflicting tempests had smitten it.

            forth). ’<em>That's</em> all right. Never let the sun go down upon your
