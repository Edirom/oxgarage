               <!--anchor1--></span>It was a maiden aunt of Stalky who sent him both books, with the
            inscription, ‘To dearest Artie, on his sixteenth birthday;’ it was
            McTurk who ordered their hypothecation; and it was Beetle, returned
            from Bideford, who flung them on the window-sill of Number Five study
            with news that Bastable would advance but ninepence on the two;
            ‘Eric; or, Little by Little,’ being almost as great a drug as ‘St.
            Winifred's.’ ‘An' I don't think much of your aunt. We're nearly out of
            cartridges, too—Artie, dear.’

         <p><span id="d26e3818">
               <!--anchor1--></span>Whereupon Stalky rose up to grapple with him, but McTurk sat on
            Stalky's head, calling him a ‘pure-minded boy’ till peace was
            declared. As they were grievously in arrears with a Latin prose, as
            it was a blazing July afternoon, and as they ought to have been at a
            house cricket-match, they began to renew their acquaintance, intimate
            and unholy, with the volumes.

         <p><span id="d26e3830">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Here we are!’ said McTurk. ‘'Corporal punishment produced on Eric the
            worst effects. He burned <em>not</em> with remorse or regret'—make a note
            o' that, Beetle—' but with shame and violent indignation. He
            glared'—oh, naughty Eric! Let's get to where he goes in for drink.’

         <p><span id="d26e3848">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Hold on half a shake. Here's another sample. 'The Sixth,' he says,'is
            the palladium of all public schools.' But this lot—’ Stalky rapped
            the gilded book—‘can't prevent fellows drinkin' and stealin', an'
            lettin' fags out of window at night, an'—an' doin' what they please.
            Golly, what we've missed—not goin' to St.  Winifred's!...’

         <p><span id="d26e3861">
               <!--anchor1--></span>Mr. Prout could move very silently if he pleased, though that is no
            merit in a boy's eyes. He had flung open the study-door without
            knocking—another sin—and looked at them suspiciously. ‘Very sorry,
            indeed, I am to see you frowsting in your studies.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e3867">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘We've been out ever since dinner, sir,’ said. McTurk wearily. One
            house-match is just like another, and their ‘ploy’ of that week
            happened to be rabbit-shooting with saloon-pistols.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e3873">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘I can't see a ball when it's coming, sir,’ said Beetle. ‘I've had my
            gig-lamps smashed at the Nets till I got excused. I wasn't any good
            even as a fag, then, sir.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e3879">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Tuck is probably your form. Tuck and brewing. Why can't you three
            take any interest in the honor of your house?’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e3882">
               <!--anchor1--></span>They had heard that phrase till they were wearied. The ‘honor of the
            house’ was Prout's weak point, and they knew well how to flick him on
            the raw.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e3889">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘If you order us to go down, sir, of course we'll go,’ said Stalky,
            with maddening politeness. But Prout knew better than that. He had
            tried the experiment once at a big match, when the three,
            self-isolated, stood to attention for half an hour in full view of
            all the visitors, to whom fags, subsidized for that end, pointed them
            out as victims of Prout's tyranny. And Prout was a sensitive man.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e3904">
               <!--anchor1--></span>In the infinitely petty confederacies of the Common-room, King and
            Macrea, fellow house-masters, had borne it in upon him that by games,
            and games alone, was salvation wrought. Boys neglected were boys
            lost. They must be disciplined. Left to himself, Prout would have
            made a sympathetic house-master; but he was never so left, and with
            the devilish insight of youth, the boys knew to whom they were
            indebted for his zeal.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e3916">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Must we go down, sir?' said McTurk.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e3922">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘I don't want to order you to do what a right-thinking boy should do
            gladly. I'm sorry.’ And he lurched out with some hazy impression that
            he had sown good seed on poor ground.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e3925">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Now what does he suppose is the use of that?’ said Beetle.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e3931">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Oh, he's cracked. King jaws him in Common-room about not keepin' us
            up to the mark, an' Macrea burbles about 'dithcipline,' an' old Heffy
            sits between 'em sweatin' big drops. I heard Oke (the Common-room
            butler) talking to Richards (Prout's house-servant) about it down in
            the basement the other day when I went down to bag some bread,’ said
            Stalky.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e3954">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘What did Oke say?’ demanded McTurk, throwing ‘Eric’ into a corner.

         <p><span id="d26e3963">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Oh, he said, 'They make more nise nor a nest full o' jackdaws, an'
            half of it like we'd no ears to our heads that waited on 'em. They
            talks over old Prout—what he've done an' left undone about his boys.
            An' how their boys be fine boys, an' his'n be dom bad.' Well, Oke
            talked like that, you know, and Richards got awf'ly wrathy. He has a
            down on King for something or other. Wonder why?’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e3975">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Why, King talks about Prout in form-room—makes allusions, an' all
            that—only half the chaps are such asses they can't see what he's
            
            drivin' at. And d'you remember what he said about the 'Casual House'
            last Tuesday? He meant us. They say he says perfectly beastly things
            to his own house, making fun of Prout's,’ said Beetle.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e3990">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Well, we didn't come here to mix up in their rows,’ McTurk said
            wrathfully. ‘Who'll bathe after call-over? King's takin' it in the
            cricket-field. Come on.’ Turkey seized his straw and led the way.

         <p><span id="d26e3999">
               <!--anchor1--></span>They reached the sun-blistered pavilion over against the gray
            Pebbleridge just before roll-call, and, asking no questions, gathered
            from King's voice and manner that his house was on the road to
            victory.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e4002">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Ah, ha!’ said he, turning to show the light of his countenance. ‘Here
            we have the ornaments of the Casual House at last. You consider
            cricket beneath you, I believe ‘—the crowd, flannelled, sniggered 
            ‘and from what I have seen this afternoon, I fancy many others of
            your house hold the same view. And may I ask what you purpose to do
            with your noble selves till tea-time?’

         <p><span id="d26e4021">
               <!--anchor1--></span>King scowled. ’<em>One</em> of you was that thing called a water-funk. Yes, a
            water-funk.  So now you wish to wash? It is well. Cleanliness never
            injured a boy or—a house. We will proceed to business,’ and he
            addressed himself to the call-over board.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e4027">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘What the deuce did you say anything to him for, Beetle?’ said McTurk
            angrily, as they strolled towards the big, open sea-baths.

         <p><span id="d26e4055">
               <!--anchor1--></span>A knot of King's boys, also bound for the baths, hailed them,

         <p><span id="d26e4058">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘That's what comes of King's jawin' and messin'. Those young animals

         <p><span id="d26e4064">
               <!--anchor1--></span>The boys came nearer, shouting an opprobrious word. At last they moved
            to windward, ostentatiously holding their noses.

         <p><span id="d26e4068">

               <!--anchor1--></span>When they returned from the baths, damp-headed, languid, at peace with
            the world, Beetle's forecast came only too true. They were met in the
            corridor by a fag—a common, Lower-Second fag—who at arm's length
            handed them a carefully wrapped piece of soap ‘with the compliments
            of King's House.’

            Prout's house did not wash and were therefore noisome. Mr. King was
            pleased to smile succulently in form when one of his boys drew aside
            from Beetle with certain gestures.

            excited and angry meeting of all save the prefects, whose dignity,
            though they sympathized, did not allow them to attend. They read
            ungrammatical resolutions, and made speeches beginning, ‘Gentlemen,
            we have met on this occasion,’ and ending with, ‘It's a beastly
            shame,’ precisely as houses have done since time and schools began.

            Down in the basement, where the gas flickers and the boots stand in
            racks, Richards, amid his blacking-brushes, held forth to Oke of the
            Common-room, Gumbly of the dining-halls, and fair Lena of the
            laundry.

            all shipshape, though her smelt like to bilges.’

            with the top-board, an' she were lying on her back, an' I turned un
            ovver with the brume-handle, an' 'twas her back was all covered with
            the plaster from 'twixt the lathin'. Yiss, I tal 'ee. An' under her
            head there lay, like, so's to say, a little pillow o' plaster druv up
            in front of her by raison of her slidin' along on her back. No cat
            niver went mousin' on her back, Lena. Some one had shoved her along
            right underneath, so far as they could shove un. Cats don't make
            theyselves pillows for to die on. Shoved along, she were, when she
            was settin' for to be cold, laike.’
